       "\"Let's denote the width of the rectangle as x. Therefore, the length will be 2x (given that it's twice the width).\\n\\nFrom the problem, we know that the length of the diagonal is 5√5. \\n\\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for x, because in every rectangle, the length, width, and diagonal form a right triangle.\\n\\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem: (Length)^2 + (Width)^2 = (Diagonal)^2.\\n\\nIn our case: (2x)^2 + (x)^2 = (5√5)^2. \\n\\nThis simplifies to: 4x^2 + x^2 = 125.\\n\\nCombining like terms will give us: 5x^2 = 125. \\n\\nBy isolating x, we get x^2 = 25 and taking the square root we get x = 5 (we disregard the negative root because length can't be negative).\\n\\nThus, the length equals 2 times 5, which is 10, and the width is 5.\\n\\nThe area of a rectangle is found by the formula Length x Width. \\n\\nSubstituting our values in gives us: 10 * 5 = 50.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is:\\n\\nAnswer: C\""
