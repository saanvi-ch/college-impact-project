Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

To solve this problem, we can use the following key idea:

We'll first find the coordinates of points A and B by setting the equation of the parabola equal to the y-coordinate of the line (y = 4). This will give us the x-coordinates of points A and B. Since the distance between A and B is 6, we can create an equation using these x-coordinates.

Once we have the x-coordinates of points A and B, we can calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from each of these points to the origin.

The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Therefore, the square of the distance is just $(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2$.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances to the origin for points A and B will be:
\[
d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (x_A^2 + y_A^2) + (x_B^2 + y_B^2)
\]

Given that y_A and y_B are both 4 (since they lie on the line y = 4), we can simplify this sum as:
\[
d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (x_A^2 + 16) + (x_B^2 + 16)
\]

Now let's find the x-coordinates of A and B, and subsequently solve for the sum of the squares of the distances.

Here is the Python code to do this:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the symbols
k, l, x = symbols('k l x')

# Define the equation of the parabola and the line
parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l
line = 4

# Set up the equation to find x-coordinates of the intersection points A and B
equation = Eq(parabola, line)

# Solve for the x-coordinates of points A and B
x_coords = solve(equation, x)

# Given that the distance between A and B is 6, we have the following equation
# |x_B - x_A| = 6
# (We could find which one is x_A or x_B by checking the direction of the parabola, but for the distance squared to the origin
# it does not make a difference)
# We will consider the positive square root for the distance
distance_equation = Eq(abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0]), 6)

# Solve for k or l (whichever is more convenient)
k_solution = solve(distance_equation, k)

# Now, assuming the difference in x_coordinates resolves to k, we can use any of the x_coordinates to find the sum of squares
# of distances. Considering the symmetry, sum of distances from A and B to origin will be same and equals to x_A^2 + 16 + x_B^2 + 16.
# We can compute this sum by substituting any solved value of k into one of the x-coordinates.

# Calculate the sum of squares of distances from A and B to the origin
d_squared_A = (x_coords[0].subs(k, k_solution[0]))**2 + 16
d_squared_B = (x_coords[1].subs(k, k_solution[0]))**2 + 16
sum_d_squares = d_squared_A + d_squared_B

print(sum_d_squares)
```

In the code, we have used sympy to symbolically solve the equations, and we've set up the definitions for the parabola and the line, solved for their intersection points, and then used the known distance between A and B to find the values of k. Finally, we calculated the sum of squares of the distances of A and B from the origin, assuming that one of the solutions for k is valid.

Let's run these calculations. After that, we can get the answer and put it in the $\boxed{}$ format.

It seems there was an error in the approach I initially described. Let us modify our strategy. Instead of solving directly for the separation, let's first find the x-coordinates of points A and B and then set up the equation for the distance between them, ensuring we handle the absolute value appropriately. Then we can find the sum of the squares of the distances.

Given that the parabola intersects the line y = 4 at points A and B, and these points have a distance of 6 apart, we can write the equation of the parabola and the line as:

Parabola: $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$

Line: $y = 4$

We are interested in the x-coordinates where these two equations are equal. So we equate the two:

$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$$

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let the solutions to this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$. We know that the distance between the points $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ is 6:

$$|x_2 - x_1| = 6$$

We can find the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ and then use this equation to create a new equation in terms of k and l. Note that we must take care to consider that $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be in any order, so the absolute value is important.

Now let's find the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ using sympy:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

# Define the symbols
k, l, x = symbols('k l x')

# Define the equation of the parabola and the line
parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l
line_y = 4

# Set up the equation to find x-coordinates of the intersection points A and B
equation = Eq(parabola, line_y)

# Solve for the x-coordinates of points A and B
x_coords = solve(equation, x)

# Ensure we have two solutions for the quadratic equation
if len(x_coords) == 2:
    x1, x2 = x_coords

    # Equation |x2 - x1| = 6
    distance_eq = Eq(abs(x2 - x1), 6)

    # Sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin, simplified
    sum_d_squares = simplify((x1**2 + 16) + (x2**2 + 16))

    # Now we need to solve for k and l using the distance equation
    # We should solve for distance_eq in terms of k or l then calculate sum_d_squares
    print('Distance equation:', distance_eq)
    print('Sum of squares of distances:', sum_d_squares)
else:
    print("Unexpected number of intersection points")
```

After running this code, we will have the equation for the distance in terms of k and l, and once that's correct, we will know the sum of the squares of the distances to the origin. Let's run this code block to get the equations we need to solve next.

Distance equation: Eq(Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k - (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k), 6)
Sum of squares of distances: 2*(18*k - l + 4)/k

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The distance equation we derived is:
$$ \left | \frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} - \frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} \right | = 6 $$

This equation simplifies to the fact that the absolute value of the difference in the roots of the quadratic, once simplified, should equal 6. This difference can be directly computed from the quadratic formula, where the absolute difference between roots is $\frac{2\sqrt{\Delta}}{|a|}$, with $\Delta$ being the discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$, which is $b^2-4ac$. 

For our quadratic $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, we have $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. The discriminant $\Delta = (-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$.

Therefore, the absolute difference between the roots is:

$$ \left | \frac{2\sqrt{\Delta}}{|a|} \right | = \left | \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} \right | = \left | \frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} \right | $$

Since we want this difference to be 6, we set it equal to 6 and solve for $k$ and $l$:

$$ \left | \frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} \right | = 6 $$

We can now resolve this equation using sympy, and subsequently substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ into the sum of squares of distances equation to find our desired sum.

Let's write the Python code to solve this:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt, simplify

# Define the symbols
k, l = symbols('k l', real=True, positive=True)

# Compute discriminant of the quadratic
delta = 4*k**2 - 4*k*l + 16*k

# Our distance equation comes down to the absolute difference of x-coordinates being 6
# We don't need absolute value since k and l are positive and k is in the denominator, which is squared anyway.
distance_equation = Eq(2 * sqrt(delta) / k, 6)

# Solve for k in terms of l or vice versa
solutions = solve(distance_equation, k)

# We expect two solutions for k because quadratic solutions can be mirrored.
print("Solutions for k:", solutions)

# We substitute solutions back into the sum of squares of distances. 
# Let's denote it as S for convenience.
S = 2*(18*k - l + 4)/k

# Simplify the expression with the particular solution for k and compute the value
for sol in solutions:
    sum_of_squares = simplify(S.subs(k, sol))
    print("Sum of squares of distances for k =", sol, ":", sum_of_squares)
```

Running the above code will provide the solutions for $k$ and then we can find the sum of the squares of distances $d_A^2 + d_B^2$ with the value of $k$ substituted back into the equation.

Distance equation: Eq(Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k - (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k), 6)
Sum of squares of distances: 2*(18*k - l + 4)/k
Solutions for k: [16/5 - 4*l/5]
Sum of squares of distances for k = 16/5 - 4*l/5 : 77/2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The solution for $k$ in terms of $l$ is:

$$ k = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{4l}{5} $$

When we substitute this back into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin $d_A^2 + d_B^2$, we get:

$$ d_A^2 + d_B^2 = \frac{77}{2} $$

This is the final answer to the problem. The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is:

$$ \boxed{\frac{77}{2}} $$
