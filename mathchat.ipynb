Let us modify our strategy. Instead of solving directly for the separation, let\\'s first find the x-coordinates of points A and B and then set up the equation for the distance between them, ensuring we handle the absolute value appropriately. Then we can find the sum of the squares of the distances.\\n\\nGiven that the parabola intersects the line y = 4 at points A and B, and these points have a distance of 6 apart, we can write the equation of the parabola and the line as:\\n\\nParabola: $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$\\n\\nLine: $y = 4$\\n\\nWe are interested in the x-coordinates where these two equations are equal. So we equate the two:\\n\\n$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$$\\n\\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let the solutions to this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$. We know that the distance between the points $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ is 6:\\n\\n$$|x_2 - x_1| = 6$$\\n\\nWe can find the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ and then use this equation to create a new equation in terms of k and l.

This difference can be directly computed from the quadratic formula, where the absolute difference between roots is $\\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}}{|a|}$, with $\\\\Delta$ being the discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$, which is $b^2-4ac$. \\n\\nFor our quadratic $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, we have $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$.
