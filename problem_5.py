Final Response: 

Here is an example of a similar problem:

There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of six 3-digit positive integers. What is their sum?

<scratch>
A geometric sequence is given by a and r, via a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, ar^5 ... 
These must all be integers, which is a strong constraint.
Let's first try a an integer and r an integer. 
Well, our best try is a = 100 , r = 2. But this only gives us 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200.
This fails as 1600 is not a 3-digit number.

However, we may try r to be a non-integer, say a rational number p/q. This requires that 
a is divisible by q^5. It makes sense to try q = 2, as this is the smallest possible value.

Doing so gives us a = 128, r = 3/2, giving us 128, 192, 288, 432, 648, 972. 

Summing these gives us 128 + 192 + 288 + 432 + 648 + 972 =  2660.
</scratch>

Final Response: Thus the answer is 2660.

Now please solve the original problem.

Step 1: Recognize that the intersection points of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ will be the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.

Step 2: Set up the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and re-arrange it into a quadratic form $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$. 

Step 3: Draw a sketch showing that the x-coordinates of point A and B are the roots of this quadratic equation (which can be found using the quadratic formula), and y-coordinate is always 4.

Step 4: Notice that the difference in x-coordinates of A and B is equal to 6. Using the quadratic formula, this or the sum of roots can be written as the square root of (the square of the sum of roots minus 4 times the product of roots). Given the sum and product of roots for a quadratic equation, write this equation, replacing sum and product of roots.

Step 5: Using the formula for the distance of a point from the origin, write an expression for the distances of A and B from the origin in terms of the roots of the quadratic equation.

Step 6: Use the sum of the squares of these distances to obtain the required expression.

Step 7: Plug in the information obtained from Step 4 into the expression for the sum of squares of distances from Step 6 to obtain the required result.
