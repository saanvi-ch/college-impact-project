      "To solve for $f(100)$ we need to utilize the given functional equations $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Here are the steps we'll take to solve the problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Find a useful starting point:** \n",
      "   - We know that the function $f$ takes a natural number to another natural number. So let us try to find some values of $f(n)$ for some specific values of $n$ using the functional equations provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Apply the second equation to a simple value:**\n",
      "   - Use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=1$ to find $f(2)$. Since $f$ is a function from the positive integers to the positive integers, it means that $f(1)$ must exist and is a positive integer. \n",
      "   - We can find the value of $f(1)$ using the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \\cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, which tells us that $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$ since the only positive integer which is 1 when multiplied by 8 and then having 7 subtracted from it is 1 itself.\n",
      "   - Since $f$ is a function (and functions have a single unique output for each input), we can deduce that $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ and therefore, $f(1) = 1$.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Calculate $f(2)$:**\n",
      "   - Substitute $n=1$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ you get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Iterate the second equation to find $f(4)$ and $f(8)$:**\n",
      "   - Now use the value of $f(2)$ to calculate $f(4)$ with $n=2$, that is, $f(2 \\cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.\n",
      "   - Next, calculate $f(8)$ using $n=4$, so we have $f(2 \\cdot 4) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 7 + 1 = 15$.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use the first equation to find $f(3)$:**\n",
      "   - Now we want to use the first equation to find other values of $f(n)$. To do this, let's look at the inputs where the function equals 2 or 4, since we know their outputs. We don't directly have $f(n)=2$ or $f(n)=4$, but we know $f(2)=3$, so let's use the inverse to get $f(f(2))=f(3)=4$.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Advance to $f(6)$ and $f(12)$:**\n",
      "   - With $f(3)=4$ in hand, calculate $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2\\cdot4+1=9$.\n",
      "   - Next calculate $f(12)=2f(6)+1=2\\cdot9+1=19$.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Connect the values to find $f(100)$:**\n",
      "   - Now we have both $f(8)=15$ and $f(12)=19$. To find $f(100)$, break 100 down to a combination of 8 and 12 that we can use with $f(2n)$. Notice that $100=8\\cdot12+4\\cdot1$. \n",
      "   - As such, use the relationship $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ multiple times starting from $f(8)$ to get to $f(100)$. We may need to deduce more intermediate $f$ values of powers of 2 to make this leap.\n",
      "   - Since we know $f(8)=15$, we can find $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2\\cdot15+1=31$.\n",
      "   - Then $f(32)=2f(16)+1=2\\cdot31+1=63$.\n",
      "   - And $f(64)=2f(32)+1=2\\cdot63+1=127$.\n",
      "   - Now we need $f(4)$, and since $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2\\cdot3 + 1 = 7$, which we already calculated.\n",
      "   - Then calculate $f(100)$ based on $f(64)$ and $f(4)$, because $100=64+32+4$. But keep in mind, the function $f$ isn't necessarily additive; in fact, it is not additive given the functional equations. So, we cannot just add $f(64)+f(32)+f(4)$ and expect to get $f(100)$. We will need to find another way or direct calculation of $f(100)$ using the properties we know (specifically the second property relating $f(2n)$ and $f(n)$) to find the answer.\n",
      "   - A potential next step could be to use $f(50)=f(2\\cdot25)=2f(25)+1$ and calculate backwards, knowing that $f(25)$ would be tied to a smaller term we may be able to calculate based on $f(8)=15$, $f(4)=7$, and $f(2)=3$. The goal is to use these bases to build up to the terms we need.\n",
      "   - However, since $25$ is not a multiple of $2$, $4$, or $8$, this approach stalls at this point, showing that we need more information or a different tactic.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Reevaluating the strategy:** \n",
      "   - It seems we have reached an impasse with the current information. With the given functional equations, we need to find another identity or combination of operations that allow us to express $f(100)$ in terms of known $f(n)$ values. It is a common strategy in these types of problems to look for patterns or try to use the provided equations to deduce further values.\n",
      "   - Another approach could be to express $100$ as a sum of terms involving $12$ and $8$, and some powers of $2$, but this has already shown to have significant challenges due to lack of linearity.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Look for additional information or patterns:** \n",
      "   - Revisit the provided equations, and try to find a pattern or relationship by calculating additional $f(n)$ values that could help us in relating $f(100)$ to known values. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the solution has to account for the fact that the function $f$ may not behave in a simple additive or multiplicative way, and that we are limited by the fact that we're working with the domain and codomain of natural numbers. This implies that any shortcuts taken by assuming linearity or other properties not given in the problem are not valid.\n",

      "Upon reviewing the solution strategy and considering the impasse reached in point 8, it seems I overlooked a key insight that can be derived from the functional equations provided. We need to synchronize the use of the two functional equations to find $f(100)$ systematically. In order to achieve this, let's revisit our steps and include a crucial observation about the interplay between the two equations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that $f(2)=3$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can employ the following strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, set $f(1)=1$ based on the reasoning from the previous steps.\n",

      "Now, knowing $f(2)=3$, let's calculate $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2\\cdot3+1=7$.\n",

      "- $f(64)=2f(32)+1=2\\cdot63+1=127$\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, observe that since $100=64+32+4$, we cannot directly compute $f(100)$ by simply combining the known values of $f(64), f(32), and f(4)$ since $f$ is not necessarily additive. However, the repeated application of the second functional equation suggests a way to climb up to $f(100)$ through powers of two and their sums that align with the doubling nature of the function. Noticing that $100=4\\cdot25$ can lead to new insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that $f(100)$ is not directly given by an equation involving smaller $f(n)$ for some $n$ means we need to cleverly make use of the $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's focus on applying this equation progressively to $f(100)$ to bridge it back to a known function value:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we aim to find $f(25)$. Considering $50 = 16 + 16 + 16 + 2$, we would proceed further by investigating if there's a way to extract values for $f(25)$ or $f(50)$ based on the iterative application of the doubling function rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that $f(50)$ would be simpler to evaluate if we had $f(25)$, but we must ensure that any $n$ we use to find $f(50)$ is directly obtainable from known values or from the given functional equations. This demands an attentiveness to how $n$ can be broken down by the doubling rule of $f$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, please remember that in such complex functional problems, there might be multiple approaches or hidden patterns which are not immediately obvious. It may require exploration of various paths and repeated application of the given functional equations to unlock the relationship between $f(100)$ and the known values of $f(n)$ for specific positive integers $n$. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, let me calculate directly $f(50)$ and then $f(100)$ by leveraging the second functional equation repeatedly. Here's how to calculate $f(50)$:\n",
      "\n",
      "We already have $f(8) = 15$ and $f(16) = 31$, so using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:\n",

In case of any mistakes, it is essential to revisit the functional equations and adjust the solution accordingly.\n",

      "The provided solution contains a critical error. The functional equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ does not allow us to progress with the same value for both $f(48)$ and $f(50)$, as this would suggest a violation of a well-defined function, specifically that $f(n)$ would not be injective (i.e., distinct values of $n$ give the same value of $f(n)$ which isn't consistent with the first functional equation given the nature of $8n-7$).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue arises from assuming that we could somehow use the same process to get $f(48)$ and $f(50)$ when these numbers differ by more than just a factor of 2 and therefore require separating them into individual calculations based on previous values obtained from the second functional equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.\n",
      "\n",
      "To correct this, we need to follow a consistent application of the equations that does not violate any of the properties of well-defined functions. We restart the problem using the two given equations:\n",

      "First, let's find $f(1)$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \\cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, and by the properties of functions, we must have $f(1)=1$ (we find this by considering what would happen if $f(f(1))=k$, where $k$ is not 1, and therefore, $f(k)$ could not be 1 as per the given equation).\n",

      "So far, so good. Now, we need to work towards finding $f(100)$. One way to proceed is to look for a power of $2$ close to 100. The closest such power is $64$, which we can get by doubling $32$. So let's find $f(32)$ using the same process:\n",

      "\n",
      "But to calculate $f(100)$ directly, we need to infer $f(50)$ as $100 = 2 \\cdot 50$. This is where we would like to apply the second equation, but we do not have $f(25)$ directly. We either need to find a way to express $f(25)$ through known values or derive a new equation that can be used with $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ backward to help find unknown values like $f(25)$.\n",

      "\n",
      "Given this new information, $f(2) = 2$, not 3 as we previously thought. Let's correct this and proceed:\n",
      "\n",
      "$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \\times 2 + 1 = 5$\n",
      "\n",
      "Following this corrected sequence:\n",
      "\n",
      "$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \\times 5 + 1 = 11$\n",

      "\n",
      "Here's where it gets tricky because we need to figure out how to move from $f(64)$ to $f(100)$ using only the two given equations. We might try to apply the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get from $f(50)$ to $f(100)$, but we don't have $f(50)$, and there's no obvious way to get there from the numbers we do have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a fresh insight to help us solve the problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use the fact that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find a recursive relationship that can help us calculate $f(100)$ without knowing $f(50)$. Let's consider a general form of this equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ f(2^kn) = 2f(2^{k-1}n) + 1 $$\n",
      "\n",
      "This general form helps us understand how the function $f(n)$ transforms when we multiply its argument by $2$. Now, let's find a way to express $100$ as the result of a series of operations, starting from numbers for which we know $f(n)$, and involving only multiplication by $2$ and addition by $1$.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find $f(100)$ without the value of $f(50)$, we can think of calculating $f(100)$ by applying $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ backward (thinking inversely):\n",
      "\n",
      "A desired inverse operation based on $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ isn't easily obtainable due to the complexity of the functional relationship. However, we can think about the problem by trying to bridge from known $f(n)$ values to $f(100)$ in a way that adheres to the function's defined behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our strategy is to iteratively apply the given functional equations, watching how they link together. No single application directly reveals $f(100)$, but we're looking for a pathway to connect our known values to $f(100)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we face such complexities, we might need to invoke deeper properties or relationships that stem from the original functional equations. It could be through inductive reasoning, wherein we extrapolate from the patterns observed in $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, $f(32)$, and $f(64)$. For example, we could look for a direct or indirect correlation between the inputs and outputs we've calculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going further requires additional insight or a realization about the nature of the function based on the given information. Specifically, we must delve into the behavior of $f$ revealed by $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and how this interacts with $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. It's clear that these equations suggest an intricate relationship that goes beyond the simple doubling and adding one. It looks like $f(f(f(n)))$ applies the function three times, which may be the key to unraveling the method to arrive at $f(100)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, what we see is that to follow this approach as initially laid out requires breaking down $f(100)$ into expressions involving known values that can be derived from applying $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. It may involve iteratively applying this equation to crawl upwards to larger values of $n$ from known values, or we may need to introduce a new method to handle values that are not just double a previously found $n$. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking another look at how the recursive equation works, if we want to go from $f(50)$ to $f(100)$, knowing that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we could try to see how this kind of relation scales down. For instance, if we were to continue with, say, $f(25)$, to get to $f(50)$, the pattern would continue. However, remember that we cannot simply divide by 2 to go downwards because we are restricted to the natural numbers' domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given all of this, it is time to regroup and reconsider the approach to determine an effective way to apply these functions without directly knowing $f(50)$. It is necessary to either find a new relation from the given equations or to detect a novel pattern in the results gained so far, which can then be used to reach the solution for $f(100)$.\n",
