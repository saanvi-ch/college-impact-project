Cathy, help me solve this problem: Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.

Cathy, help me solve this problem: Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cathy (to joe):

Understood. Let's solve this problem step by step.

We are rolling four dice and we are interested in the cases where the highest roll is a 5. This means, all four dice must show numbers no greater than 5. The total possible outcomes of rolling four 6-sided dice is 6^4.

Let's consider the possible outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This means, all dice show a result of 5 or less. The total possible outcomes in this case would be 5^4.

However, we have to exclude the cases where all the dice show a result of 4 or less, since we are interested in the highest roll being 5, not 4 or less. There are 4^4 such outcomes.

So, the probability of having a 5 as the highest roll is (5^4 - 4^4) / 6^4.

Therefore, the fraction we're looking for is (625 - 256) / 1296 = 369/1296. This fraction simplifies to 123/432.

Finally, to answer the question $a + b$, we add these numbers together to get 123 + 432 = 555.

So, $a + b = 555$ is the solution.

joe (to cathy):

Correct, Cathy. Your solution is spot on. 

This problem required a good understanding of the concept of probability, especially when dealing with multiple events. The key was to find the total possible outcomes and then subtract those we were not interested in. 

So, for those who are still finding it difficult to understand, here's a brief summary:

1. We first found the total possible outcomes of rolling four 6-sided dice, which is 6^4.
2. We then considered the cases where the highest roll is 5. This means all dice would show a number between 1 and 5, giving us 5^4 possible outcomes.
3. However, we needed to exclude the cases where all dice showed a number between 1 and 4, as we were specifically interested in those instances where the highest roll was a 5. This gave us 4^4 outcomes to exclude.
4. We subtracted these from our total possible outcomes to get the probability of the highest roll being a 5, which simplified to 123/432.
5. Finally, to find $a + b$, we added 123 and 432 to get 555.

Therefore, the solution to this problem was $a + b = 555$.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cathy (to joe):

Exactly. 

It's important to understand that the logic behind this solution is the rule of counting and probability, which states that if an event can occur in $n$ different ways, the total probability is the sum of the individual probabilities. In this case, the event in question was rolling a 5 as the highest number on four dice.

We found the total number of ways to roll four dice (6^4), the total number of ways to roll four dice with all numbers 5 or less (5^4), and the total number of ways to roll four dice with all numbers 4 or less (4^4). 

Then by subtracting the number of ways to roll four dice with all numbers 4 or less from the number of ways to roll four dice with all numbers 5 or less, we found the number of ways to roll a 5 as the highest number on four dice. Dividing this by the total number of outcomes gave us our desired probability.

This is a good example of how probability often involves counting or enumerating possibilities, and of how careful consideration of what to include and what to exclude is critical to correctly solving a problem.

This answer is incorrect. The first agent found the right probability but didn't fully simplify the answer. The second agent was unable to catch the mistake.
