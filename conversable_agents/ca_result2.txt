question:

(initiated by joe)
Cathy, help me solve this problem: Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?

Cathy, help me solve this problem: Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cathy (to joe):

Let's start by breaking it down.

Notice that in the best case scenario, we could color all numbers $111$ to $500$ yellow, and then all numbers $501$ to $1000$ blue. This way, any possible sum of the yellow numbers would still fall within the span of the blue numbers.

However, the problem asks us to color the numbers from $111$ to $999$. That is $999 - 111 + 1 = 889$ numbers in total. If we color half of them yellow and half of them blue, we could ensure that the sum of any two yellow numbers would still fall within the range of the blue numbers.

So if we follow this strategy, we get $889/2 = 444.5$, but we can't have half a number so we round down to get $444$ yellow numbers.

This would mean that we would have to color the numbers from $111$ to $555$ yellow and the rest blue, ensuring that the sum of any two yellow numbers would still fall within the range of the blue numbers.

The above strategy is optimal so we can confidently say that the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is $444$.

joe (to cathy):

Actually, Cathy, you are almost correct. But there is a slight error in your solution. 

You are right in that numbers from $111$ to $555$ should be yellow and the rest blue. However, there are $445$ numbers from $111$ to $555$, not $444$. 

To see this, you subtract $111$ from $555$ to get $444$, but you must add $1$ back in because both $111$ and $555$ are inclusive. So the correct answer is $445$.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cathy (to joe):

You're absolutely right, and I appreciate your correction. I apologize for the oversight. 

Indeed, the range of numbers from $111$ to $555$ inclusive gives us $555 - 111 + 1 = 445$ numbers. 

So, the maximum number of yellow numbers is indeed $445$. Thank you for pointing out the miscalculation.


comments:

This is the incorrect answer. The solution proposed by the first agent didn't account for certain sums of yellow numbers (such as 111 + 111 = 222), and the second agent was unable to catch the mistake.
