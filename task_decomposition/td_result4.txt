To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the constraints**: We need to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

2. **Simplify the constraint**: Notice that $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$ are always non-negative. For the sum of these to equal $40$, both must be at least $0$ and at least one of them has to be positive.

   Consider these two cases for the absolute values:
   - When $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, then $|x-2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y-2x| = y - 2x$.
   - When $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$, then $|x-2y| = 2y - x$ and $|y-2x| = 2x - y$.
   
   In each case, simplify and combine the equations to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ that must be satisfied.

3. **Find a relationship between $x$ and $y$**: 
   Case 1: If $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, we have $x - 2y + y - 2x = -y$. But this cannot sum to $40$, so this case is inconsistent with the constraints.
   Case 2: If $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$, then $2y - x + 2x - y = x + y$. For this sum to be $40$, we must have $x + y = 40$.

4. **Use the relationship to rewrite the expression**: If $x + y = 40$, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other (for example, $y = 40 - x$). Substitute this into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2 + 5(40 - x)^2 - 8x(40 - x)$.

5. **Simplify and find the minimum**:
   - Expand the expression: $5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - (320x - 8x^2)$.
   - Combine like terms: $5x^2 + 8000 - 400x + 5x^2 - 320x + 8x^2 = 18x^2 - 720x + 8000$.
   - To minimize this quadratic expression, find its vertex, as the quadratic coefficient is positive, indicating a parabola that opens upwards.
   - The vertex of a parabola given by $ax^2 + bx + c$ is at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. For our parabola, $x = \frac{720}{2 \times 18} = \frac{720}{36} = 20$.
   - Substitute $x = 20$ back into the original expression or into the vertex form to find the minimum value.

6. **Check feasibility**: Ensure that the value of $x$ found in step 5 satisfies the constraints. If $x = 20$, then $y = 40 - x = 40 - 20 = 20$. Thus, $x$ and $y$ are both $20$, which satisfies $x + y = 40$.

7. **Answer**: Substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 20$ into the original expression to find the minimum value:
   - $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 5(400) + 5(400) - 8(400) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the given constraints is $\boxed{800}$.

Certainly! Since we have expressions that consist of absolute values, we must consider different scenarios based on the conditions inside the absolute value brackets. The original constraint is $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. We can split this into separate cases based on the sign of the expressions within the absolute values.

Case 1: Both $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ are non-negative. So we have:
\[ x - 2y + y - 2x = -y - x = -(x + y) \]
But since the sum of the absolute values is 40, a positive number, this case is invalid as it would result in a negative sum.

Case 2: Both $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ are negative. Then we have:
\[ 2y - x + 2x - y = x + y \]
For the sum to be 40:
\[ x + y = 40 \]

Now we rewrite the expression we want to minimize in terms of $x$ using the relation from Case 2:
\[ 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5(40 - x)^2 - 8x(40 - x) \]

Let's expand and simplify the expression:
\[ 5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - 8(40x - x^2) = 5x^2 + 8000 - 400x + 5x^2 - 320x + 8x^2 \]
\[ = 18x^2 - 720x + 8000 \]

To find the vertex of this parabola, we use the vertex formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where the general form of the parabola is $ax^2 + bx + c$. Here, we have $a = 18$ and $b = -720$.

The x-coordinate of the vertex is:
\[ x = -\frac{-720}{2 \cdot 18} = \frac{720}{36} = 20 \]

Substitute $x = 20$ (from the vertex) to find the corresponding $y$-value using the relation $x + y = 40$:
\[ y = 40 - x = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 20$ into the original expression to find the minimum value:
\[ 5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) \]
\[ = 5(400) + 5(400) - 8(400) \]
\[ = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 \]
\[ = 4000 - 3200 \]
\[ = 800 \]

The minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ given the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $800$.

Checker (to chat_manager):

The solution provided by the Planner seems correct. The steps to handle the constraint involved cases for the absolute value expressions, and the correct case was identified (Case 2) where $x + y = 40$. The expression to minimize was re-written in terms of one variable and simplified correctly, leading to a quadratic expression. 

The vertex of the quadratic was found using the correct formula, and the coordinates $(20, 20)$ for $(x, y)$ were verified to satisfy the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Subsequently, substituting these values into the original expression yielded the correct minimum value of $800$.

Therefore, the solution is correctly solved and the steps used to achieve the solution are appropriate. The final answer is indeed $\boxed{800}$.
