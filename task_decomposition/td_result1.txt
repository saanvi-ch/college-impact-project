To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Find x-coordinates of A and B:**
   Since points A and B lie on the intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$, we set the two expressions equal to each other to find the x-coordinates of A and B.

2. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   The resulting equation from step 1 is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Solve this equation to find the x-coordinates of points A and B.

3. **Calculate Distances Between Points:**
   Use the distance formula to express the distance between points A and B in terms of x-coordinates found in step 2.

4. **Apply Given Distance:**
   The distance between A and B is given as 6. Use this information to find a relationship between k and l.

5. **Find the Squares of Distances to the Origin:**
   Use the distance formula again to find the squares of the distances of A and B from the origin (0,0). 

6. **Express Distances in Terms of Parameters:**
   Express the squares of these distances in terms of the parameters k and l.

7. **Sum of Squares:**
   Sum the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin.

8. **Solve for Sum:**
   Use the relationship between k and l found in step 4 to substitute into the sum of squares expression to find the required sum.

Let's begin implementing these steps.

**Step 1 & 2: Find x-coordinates of A and B and Solve Quadratic Equation**

Given that the line y = 4 intersects the parabola at points A and B, we write:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$$

This simplifies to:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$$

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x. We will use the quadratic formula to solve for x which is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$.

**Step 3 & 4: Calculate Distances Between Points and Apply Given Distance**

The distance between A and B is given by the difference in x-coordinates since they have the same y-coordinate. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of A and B, then:

$$Distance = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$$

Once we find $x_1$ and $x_2$, we can use this expression to relate them.

**Step 5 & 6: Find the Squares of the Distances to the Origin**

The square of the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2$.

So we need to calculate:
$$R_1^2 = x_1^2 + y_1^2$$
$$R_2^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2$$

Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, these simplify to:
$$R_1^2 = x_1^2 + 4^2$$
$$R_2^2 = x_2^2 + 4^2$$

**Step 7 & 8: Sum of Squares and Solve for Sum**

We want to find:
$$S = R_1^2 + R_2^2 = (x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2)$$
$$S = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2 \cdot 4^2$$
Using the relationship $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we can find the specific values of $x_1^2$ and $x_2^2$ based on the relationship between k and l, and then sum them.

Since the steps here are general, the specific algebraic solving and substitution of k and l is necessary to find the numerical value for S. Unfortunately, a closed-form solution requires further algebraic manipulation of the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$ which depends on $k$ and $l$ based on $Distance = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$ and substituting them back into expression for S to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin.

To execute the previously laid out steps, I will need to perform calculations at each stage. Below are the executed steps with accompanying calculations:

**Step 1 & 2: Solving the Quadratic Equation**

Given equations:
$$y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$$
$$y = 4$$

Setting them equal:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$$

Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$$

Now, we use the quadratic formula where $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$:
$$x = \frac{-(-2k) \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l - 4)}}{2k}$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm 2\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{2k}$$
$$x = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}$$

Let's define:
$$x_1 = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k} \quad \text{and} \quad x_2 = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}$$

**Step 3 & 4: Applying the Given Distance**

We're given that the distance $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, so:
$$\left| \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right) - \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right) \right| = 6$$
$$\left| -2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k} \right| = 6$$
$$2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k} = 6$$
$$\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k} = 3k$$
$$k^2 - kl + 4k = 9k^2$$
$$-kl + 4k = 8k^2$$
$$l = \frac{4k - 8k^2}{k}$$
$$l = 4 - 8k$$

**Step 5 & 6: Calculate the Squares of Distances to the Origin**

Using points $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$, we calculate $R_1^2$ and $R_2^2$:
$$R_1^2 = x_1^2 + 4^2 = \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2 + 16$$
$$R_2^2 = x_2^2 + 4^2 = \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2 + 16$$

**Step 7 & 8: Summing the Squares and Solving for the Sum**

Let's calculate the sum $S = R_1^2 + R_2^2$:
$$S = \left[\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2 + 16\right] + \left[\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2 + 16\right]$$
$$S = 2 + 2\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k^2} + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 2\frac{k^2 - k(4 - 8k) + 4k}{k^2} + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 2\frac{k^2 - 4k + 8k^2 + 4k}{k^2} + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 2\frac{9k^2}{k^2} + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 18 + 32$$
$$S = 52$$

Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from points A and B to the origin is $52$.

The calculations performed to find the sum of the squares of the distances from points A and B to the origin are mostly correct, but a minor error was made during the simplification in Step 7 & 8.

In Step 7 & 8, we have the sum of squares $S = R_1^2 + R_2^2$. After expanding the terms inside the square brackets, we get:

$$S = \left(1 + 2\cdot\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k} + \left(\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2\right) + 16 + \left(1 - 2\cdot\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k} + \left(\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2\right) + 16$$

Notice that the terms involving $\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}$ will cancel out when added, as they are the opposite of each other. The expression simplifies to:

$$S = \left(1 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2\right) + 16 + \left(1 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}\right)^2\right) + 16$$
$$S = 2 + 2\cdot\left(\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k^2}\right) + 2\cdot16$$

With the knowledge that $l = 4 - 8k$:

$$S = 2 + 2\cdot\left(\frac{k^2 - k(4 - 8k) + 4k}{k^2}\right) + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 2\cdot\left(\frac{k^2 - 4k + 8k^2 + 4k}{k^2}\right) + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 2\cdot\left(\frac{9k^2}{k^2}\right) + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 2\cdot9 + 32$$
$$S = 2 + 18 + 32$$
$$S = 52$$

The calculation is correct; thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from points A and B to the origin is indeed $52$. The error I pointed out did not ultimately impact the final result, but it's important to align every step accurately when verifying calculations. The final answer is correct.

This is the correct answer. However, I've gotten the answer before for this problem using another method, so I need to test some more problems before confirming if this method works.
