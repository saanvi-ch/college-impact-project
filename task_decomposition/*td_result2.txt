To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. Recognize constraints:
   - Yellow plus yellow equals blue.
   - The smallest three-digit number is 111 and the largest is 999.
   
2. Consider minimum and maximum sums of yellow to form blue:
   - The smallest sum we can get from adding two three-digit numbers is 222 (111 + 111).
   - The largest sum we can get is 1998 (999 + 999), but this would not result in a three-digit number, so we will need to consider the largest three-digit result, 999.
   
3. Make observations to reduce possibilities:
   - If 111 is yellow, then adding it to itself yields 222, which must then be blue. Continuing this reasoning, we would have a series of yellow numbers (111, 333, 555, 777, 999) because an odd number plus an odd number yields an even number, which must be blue.
   - However, this pattern doesn't work because adding two different odd numbers from the set would result in an even number that's not in the set (e.g., 111 + 333 = 444). Since all even sums must be blue and 444 is not one of the defined blue numbers, this violates the rules.
   - Thus, 111 cannot be yellow; following similar logic, no odd numbers can be yellow.

4. Consider an even start:
   - If we start with 112 as yellow and add it to itself, we get a blue number (224). This could create a potential valid sequence if we carefully pick subsequent yellow numbers.

5. Further deductions:
   - If we pick any yellows such that their sum is three digits (and it's not already designated as blue), we get a contradiction. Hence, we cannot pick two yellows whose sum is an even number between 224 and 998, inclusive, unless that sum has been forced blue.

6. Maximize yellow numbers:
   - To maximize yellow numbers, we can try to build a series starting from 112 where each new yellow number, when added to 112 (or another yellow), doesn't create an even number between 224 and 998 that hasn't been determined to be blue already.
   - For instance, picking every other even number starting from 112 as yellow, i.e., 112, 116, 120, ..., means whenever we add two yellows (112 to any other), we always get an even number above 999 (since 112 + (4*n) will be greater than 999 for n > 222/4 → n ≥ 56).

7. Calculate the maximum:
   - To find the precise maximum number of yellow numbers, we need to calculate how many even numbers there are between 112 and 998 (inclusive) when we are picking every 4th one:
     - (998 - 112) / 4 + 1 to account for both endpoints.
  
8. Execute the calculation:
   - (998 - 112) / 4 + 1
   - 886 / 4 + 1
   - 221 + 1
   - 222

So the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 222.

Calculator (to chat_manager):

The solution provided is incorrect. 222 is not the maximum number of yellows that can be present; there is a better strategy to increase this number. 

Here's the revised strategy to maximize the number of yellow numbers:

1. Divide the range 111-999 into three-digit blue and yellow numbers according to the given constraints.

2. Assume that the smallest number, 111, is blue. If it were yellow, any other yellow when added to it would result in a number that is not blue since 111 plus any other three-digit number gives a four-digit sum or an odd three-digit sum that cannot be blue without contradicting the initial assumption.

3. Since 111 is blue, the next smallest possible yellow would be 112, then the smallest possible blue that could be formed by the sum of two yellows is 112 + 112 = 224.

4. Therefore, every yellow number after 112 must be more than 112 away from any other yellow number to avoid forming a blue number that is within the three-digit range when summed.

5. Apply the skip strategy: starting at 112, skip 112 numbers and choose the next one as yellow (which would be 112 + 113 = 225), continue this pattern by adding 113 to the previous yellow number. (Note that this is not simply 'every 4th number' as previously mentioned)

6. Calculate the number of skips we can make while remaining within the 111 to 999 range.

7. The last eligible yellow number would be 999, which is formed by summing the largest even yellow (888) and the smallest yellow (112) we chose initially, showing that 888 must be yellow: 999 = 888 + 112.

8. Now, we count the number of eligible yellow numbers spaced apart by 113 within the given range.

9. We apply the formula from the first incorrect answer, in a corrected context: The first yellow is 112, then each subsequent yellow is obtained by adding 113 to the previous yellow. Compute this as:

   (888 - 112)/113 + 1

10. Execute the calculation:

   - (888 - 112)/113 + 1
   - 776/113 + 1
   - 6 + 1 (since 776 ÷ 113 is exactly 6 with no remainder)
   - 7

So the maximum number of yellow numbers within the specified constraints is 7, not including 111 or 999.

The correct sequence of yellow numbers is:

112 (1st yellow, cannot be blue because of the assumption)
225 (2nd yellow, 112 + 113)
338 (3rd yellow, 225 + 113)
451 (4th yellow, 338 + 113)
564 (5th yellow, 451 + 113)
677 (6th yellow, 564 + 113)
790 (7th yellow, 677 + 113)

Any sum of two of these numbers remains outside the three-digit blue range or coincides with a blue number already defined by prior sums, thereby adhering to the problem's constraints. This strategy ensures we have the maximum possible number of yellow numbers.

The revised calculation provided above is also incorrect, and the approach has to be reconsidered.

Let's correct the approach and solve the problem:

To determine the maximum number of yellow numbers, first, let's consider the smallest three-digit number, which is 111. If 111 is yellow, then any sum with it and another yellow number will result in either an even number or a number larger than 999. Since we are told that the sum of two yellows is a blue number, any other yellow number added to 111 cannot be another three-digit number as it would violate the rules.

Hence, we must color numbers strategically to maximize the number of yellow numbers.

Let's consider the following conclusions:

- If a number x is yellow, then 2x is blue because we can add x to itself to get 2x.
- If x and y are yellow (x ≠ y), then x + y must be blue.

Therefore, starting at 111, which we define as blue, to maximize the number of yellow numbers, we would want to start from the smallest three-digit number (112) and make every second number yellow:

Yellow numbers: 112, 114, 116, ..., 998
Blue numbers: All other three-digit numbers, including all sums of the yellow numbers.

The yellow numbers will be all even numbers from 112 to 998, and we must ensure that the sums of any two yellow numbers do not produce a previously uncolored three-digit number that would conflict with our coloring rule.

To calculate the maximum number of yellow numbers that are even from 112 to 998:

- There are 444 even numbers from 112 to 998.
- The even three-digit numbers range from 100 to 998.
- From 100 to 110, there are 5 even numbers, and from 990 to 998, there are 5 even numbers.
- Subtract these 10 numbers from the total 444 even numbers in the range.
- So, the total number of even numbers from 112 to 990 is 444 - 10 = 434.

However, this is not the correct total just yet. We need to also ensure that yellow numbers do not sum to another yellow number. For every new yellow number we add, it must be neither the sum nor the difference of any two existing yellow numbers, in order to ensure that we don't indirectly create a blue number that isn't accounted for.

Given the constraints, the problem may require a more careful construction or proof to find the correct number of yellow numbers and show why that is the maximum.

The correct process requires a deeper mathematical approach. As such, further analysis is needed to find the correct solution to this problem, considering the constraints provided.

Given the new constraint, the sum of two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers must yield a blue number, we need to structure our coloring strategy to maximize yellow numbers without violating this rule. Here's the correct approach:

1. **Define an initial strategy**: We need to pick yellow numbers in such a way that any sum of two yellow numbers results in a blue number that falls within the 111-999 range. To simplify this, we can avoid consecutive numbers as yellow because their sum would also fall within the range and might not have been colored blue yet.

2. **Start by choosing low yellow numbers**: Let's start by coloring the lowest possible numbers yellow and then determining whether any blue numbers emerge from their sums.

3. **Identify a pattern**: Given the constraints, a pattern that might emerge is to choose yellow numbers that are spaced apart by a fixed gap such that their sums cover all even possibilities.

4. **Avoid direct sums to blue**: Choosing yellow numbers that are spaced apart ensures that any direct sum will result in a number that is too high to be a three-digit number, thus defaulting to blue according to the coloring rule.

5. **Choose yellow numbers**: To maximize the number of yellow numbers, we should choose the lowest even numbers, because choosing odd numbers would quickly result in a sum that has to be blue (by parity). So, we should start with 112 as yellow and go up.

6. **Establish the spacing**: If we choose 112 as yellow, the next yellow can't be 114 because their sum, 226, is within the range and hasn't been colored yet. We need a minimum gap between yellows to avoid this conflict. Since the spread of blue numbers is even, we can apply the same logic that when any two yellows are added, they must result in an even number - specifically, a blue number that isn't disqualified by the basic parity rule.

7. **Calculate the spacing**:
   - Let's assign every even number larger than 110 to be blue first.
   - Given that the sum of any two yellows is blue and an even number, let's assume 112 is yellow.
   - The next yellow can't be 114 since that will yield the sum 226, which is an even number we have already assigned blue. Here, we must ensure that adding the next yellow to 112 doesn't result in an even number less than or equal to 998.
   - This means we must skip at least half of the interval between 112 and 998 when choosing our next yellow. However, skipping exactly half (which is 443) is not sufficient because 112 + 555, for instance, is 667, an odd number that can't be blue.

8. **Magnitude check and new spacing**: Consider the largest blue number we can make by summing an odd yellow number with the smallest yellow number, 112. This largest blue number would then be 999 - 112 = 887. We will then color the number 889 yellow because if we add any other yellow to 889, it will exceed 999 and if we subtract any potential yellow from 889, it will be less than 112 (since 889 - 887 = 2).

9. **Continue process**: After 889, the next yellow we can color would have to be more than 887 + 112 away to prevent creating an uncolored blue sum. This yellow would be 889 + 888 (since we can't use 887; 889 + 887 is still 1776, which exceeds our three-digit range). And this pattern will continue as we move up in yellows.

10. **Count yellows**: When we get to 889 as our first high yellow, we should then count how many times we can add the interval without exceeding 999. To illustrate with a simplified example, if our yellows start at 112 and our interval is 776 (since 887 + 112), we would get: 112, 889, 1776 (which is disqualified). Only 112 and 889 are valid yellows.

11. **Final adjustment**: Given this strategy, we must now find the maximum number of valid yellows while not violating our even sum rule.

So, to correctly solve the problem, you must continue this process, avoiding sums that result in uncolored blue numbers, until you reach the highest possible yellow number (close to 999). Once you do, tally up all the valid yellow numbers to find the maximum possible number of yellows.

Given that this is a complex combinatorial problem, it's easier to sketch out calculations and examine specific cases than to provide a generic algebraic formula. In an actual mathematical contest or deep problem-solving session, one might employ more precise combinatorial or number theory tactics to arrive at the answer.
