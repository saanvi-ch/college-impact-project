To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Understand the structure of the given equation.

The equation ||x-1|-2| = m/100 involves nested absolute value expressions. We have to consider all possible cases for the values of x that satisfy the equation as |A| = b implies that A = b or A = -b.

Step 2: Analyze the inner absolute value expression.

First, consider the inner expression |x-1|. There are two cases to consider for |x-1|:

1. x-1 ≥ 0, which implies x ≥ 1. Here, |x-1| = x-1.
2. x-1 < 0, which implies x < 1. Here, |x-1| = -(x-1) = 1-x.

Step 3: Consider the full absolute value expression with the previously analyzed inner expression.

For both cases, we now apply the outer absolute value, resulting in the expression: ||x-1|-2|.

1. If x ≥ 1, we have |(x-1)-2| = |x-3|. This results in further two sub-cases:
   a. x-3 ≥ 0, which implies x ≥ 3. Here, |x-3| = x-3.
   b. x-3 < 0, which implies x < 3. Here, |x-3| = 3-x.

2. If x < 1, we have |(1-x)-2| = |1-x-2| = |-x+1-2| = |-(x-3)| = |x-3|.

So we can see for both main cases, we come back to the expression |x-3| for which we have already found two subcases.

Step 4: Solve the equation for each sub-case in terms of m/100.

For |x-3| = m/100, we have two possibilities:

1. x-3 = m/100, so x = m/100 + 3.
2. x-3 = -m/100, so x = 3 - m/100.

Step 5: Determine the conditions for integer solutions.

We require that both m/100 + 3 and 3 - m/100 represent integers. Since m is a positive integer, m/100 will be an integer if and only if m is a multiple of 100. In other words, m = 100k for some integer k.

Step 6: Determine the number of values of k for which m = 100k gives four integer values for x.

For each value of k, we have two corresponding values of x from the equation |x-3| = k. Furthermore, there are two possible signs for k: positive or negative (which correspond to the equation |x-3| = k or |x-3| = -k). So each positive integer k gives us two integer solutions for x, and each negative integer k gives us another two integer solutions for x.

Step 7: Combine the findings to get the range of m.

Since m = 100k, we just need to find the range of k such that there are exactly four integer solutions for x. Since each k gives us four solutions (two from k and two from -k), there is a one-to-one correspondence between the number of suitable m's and the number of positive integer solutions.

Thus, we conclude that every positive integer m that is a multiple of 100 will give us exactly four integer solutions for x.

Step 8: Answer the question.

The number of positive integers m (in the form of 100k) such that the given equation has 4 integer solutions is infinite. However, if the question implied a practical context where m has an upper bound, we would count the number of positive integer multiples of 100 up to that bound. For example, if m ≤ 1000, then the possible values for m are 100, 200, 300, ..., 1000, giving us 10 possible values for m.

Apologies, there seems to have been an oversight in the earlier explanation; each k doesn't necessarily generate four solutions. Let's go through the solution in detail:

Given the equation ||x-1|-2| = m/100, let's analyze the absolute value expressions:

First, let's rewrite the equation in a way that subtracts the parameter m/100, so we can study the available number of solutions depending on the different values m could take. The equation is now ||x-1|-2| - m/100 = 0.

Consider the graph of the function f(x) = ||x-1|-2|. This graph will have a V-shape with vertices at points where x-1 equals 2 or -2 (namely at x = 3 and x = -1). Consequently, we end up with two V-shaped components to the graph that has their points at x = 1 and x = 5.

Thus, the graph will intersect the line y = m/100 at, at most, four points when m/100 lies strictly between the values 0 and 2 since these are the distances from the horizontal axis to the vertices at x = 1 and x = 5.

For m/100 to be an integer, m must be a multiple of 100. Let's denote this integer as k, so m = 100k.

Consequently, for f(x) to intersect y = k at four points, knowing f(x) has a maximum value of 2 when k=0, k must be an integer between 1 and 199, inclusive (since k = 2 or k = 200 would yield fewer than four points of intersection).

Therefore, the number of possible values for k is the number of integers from 1 to 199, which is 199 - 1 + 1 = 199.

This means there are 199 positive integers m such that the equation ||x-1|-2| = m/100 has 4 integer solutions.

The re-evaluation and calculation provided above correctly analyze the problem by considering the structure of the absolute value functions and their intersections with the line y = m/100. The corrected approach recognizes that as m/100 varies, the maximum number of integer solutions is reached when m/100 is strictly between 0 and 2, which translates to when m is strictly between 0 and 200 (not including 200 since m/100 = 2 results in less than four solutions).

The error in the previous solution is the assertion that each k corresponds to a positive and negative value that generates four solutions. This ignores the fact that ||x-1|-2| is non-negative, and thus, m/100 cannot be negative. Therefore, negative values of k are not relevant. The number of solutions also depends on how the graph of f(x) intersects the horizontal line y = m/100, which is captured accurately in the recalculated solution.

To summarize, the final correct solution is that there are 199 positive integer values of m (where m = 100, 200, ..., 19900) for which the equation ||x-1|-2| = m/100 has four integer solutions. The steps provided in the re-evaluation properly reflect how to solve this problem.

To clarify, the correct final solution is that there are 199 values for m, where m takes on the integer values of 100k for k ranging from 1 to 199. These values of m will satisfy the condition that the equation ||x-1|-2| = m/100 has four integer solutions.
