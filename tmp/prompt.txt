Final Response: 

Here is an example of a similar problem:

Problem: Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?

We can try the quadratic formula to find the x-coordinates of the points of intersection.
The quadratic formula gives 
x = (2k ± sqrt(4k^2 - 4k(l-4)))/2k = 1 ± sqrt(1 + l/k - 1) = 1 ± sqrt(l/k), 
which seems to complex to deal with. Let's try to find a simpler way

The points are distance 6 apart, but also are on the same horizontal line. This means that the 
x-coordinates are distance six apart. Furthermore, this mean the x-coordinate of the vertex 
of the parabola is the midpoint of the x-coordinates of A and B. But we know the vertex of the
parabola is where the derivative is zero. So we can find the vertex by taking the derivative of
the parabola and setting it equal to zero. This gives us the x-coordinate of the vertex, via
the formula $x = 1$. 

So, now we know the x-coordinate of the vertex is 1. Thus the x-coordinates of A and B are -2 and 4. 
So the points of A and B are (-2, 4) and (4, 4). 

Now using the distance formula, we can find the distance of A and B from the origin, we find
the distance of A from the origin is sqrt(20) and the distance of B from the origin is sqrt(32).
So the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 20 + 32 = 52.
