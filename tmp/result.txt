To solve the problem of finding the sum of the five numbers in the unique increasing geometric sequence of two-digit positive integers, we will approach it step by step.

<scratch>
Let's denote the five numbers in the geometric sequence as 
a
,
a
r
,
a
r
2
,
a
r
3
,
a
r
4
a,ar,ar 
2
 ,ar 
3
 ,ar 
4
 , where 
a
a is the first term and 
r
r is the common ratio. Since they are all two-digit numbers, we have: 
10
≤
a
<
100
10≤a<100 
10
≤
a
r
4
<
100
10≤ar 
4
 <100

This means that the sequence should be bounded within the range of two-digit numbers.

The sequence being unique means that there should be only one possible set of such numbers.

First, let's estimate the value of 
r
r. The ratio 
r
r must be greater than 1, but it cannot be too large, or the terms will exceed two digits. We will try integer values for 
r
r first and check if they satisfy the conditions.

Case 1: 
r
=
2
r=2

The sequence is 
a
,
2
a
,
4
a
,
8
a
,
16
a
a,2a,4a,8a,16a.
For 
a
a to be a two-digit number and 
16
a
16a also to be a two-digit number, 
a
a must satisfy:
10
≤
a
<
100
/
16
=
6.25
(
which is impossible, as 
a
 cannot be two digits and less than 6.25
)
10≤a<100/16=6.25(which is impossible, as a cannot be two digits and less than 6.25)
Case 2: 
r
=
3
/
2
=
1.5
r=3/2=1.5

The sequence is 
a
,
1.5
a
,
2.25
a
,
3.375
a
,
5.0625
a
a,1.5a,2.25a,3.375a,5.0625a.
We now have:
10
≤
5.0625
a
<
100
10≤5.0625a<100
This gives us:
a
≥
10
5.0625
≈
1.975
and
a
<
100
5.0625
≈
19.75
a≥ 
5.0625
10
​	
 ≈1.975anda< 
5.0625
100
​	
 ≈19.75
Therefore, 
a
a must be an integer between 2 and 19.
Trying 
a
=
16
a=16:

The sequence is 
16
,
24
,
36
,
54
,
81
16,24,36,54,81.
All terms are two-digit integers, and they are in increasing order. This is a valid sequence.
Finally, let's calculate the sum:

16
+
24
+
36
+
54
+
81
=
211
16+24+36+54+81=211
Conclusion: The only valid sequence is 
16
,
24
,
36
,
54
,
81
16,24,36,54,81, and their sum is 211.

Final Response: The sum of the five numbers in the unique increasing geometric sequence is 211.
