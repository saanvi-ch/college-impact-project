0. Git and Github: Done 

    We will use github to share our code

1. Make a folder just for this project

2. Download vscode
    https://code.visualstudio.com/

    Vscode is a powerful IDE

    Open the folder you made in vscode

3. Download the data from Kaggle into this folder

    It's in a "zip" file

    Unzip the file (zip is a way to compress files, can just double click)


4. Follow the Video or just the website to get openai going 

5. Try to solve some of the math problems 

6. Try to solve some of them using AI
