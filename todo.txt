0. Git and Github: Done 

    We will use github to share our code

1. Make a folder just for this project: Done

2. Download vscode :Done
    https://code.visualstudio.com/

    Vscode is a powerful IDE

    Open the folder you made in vscode

3. Download the data from Kaggle into this folder: Done

    It's in a "zip" file

    Unzip the file (zip is a way to compress files, can just double click)


4. Follow the Video or just the website to get openai going : Done

5. Try to solve some of the math problems : TODO

6. Try to solve some of them using AI : TODO

7. Decide if you like the Olympiad Problems or choose anything else. : Done


----- 

Just a suggestion 

1. Admin directs to planner 
2. Planner creates an itemized gameplan
3. Checker of the Plan, confirms a good gameplan
4. Possibly repeat 1 and 2, until the checker confirms (MAKE SURE you have a limit on the number of back and forth)
5. Now you have an itemized template for how to solve the problem 
6. Now pass on the template to the mathematician/calculator
7. Have them solve exactly one step at a time
8. Checker checks the solution

Example: Planner gives 
step 1 
step 2 
step 3

Caclulator gives 
step 1:
Solution 1

step2:

step3:

Checker, checks

Caclulator gives 
step 1:
Solution 1

step2:
Solution 2

step3:

Checker, checks


9. Final Solution proposed 
10. Another checker comes in and verifies 
11. TERMINATE


Nothing specific about problem  <-------->  Solve the problem in the prompt 

Think of this as a scale from 1 - 10.
