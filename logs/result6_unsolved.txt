Solve this problem:
For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?

Answer:

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation:
||x - 1| - 2| = m/100

This equation suggests that |x - 1| - 2 = m/100 or |x - 1| - 2 = -m/100
    Case 1: |x - 1| - 2 = m/100
    |x - 1| = 2 + m/100
    Case 2: |x - 1| - 2 = -m/100
    |x - 1| = 2 - m/100

Each case results in two equations:
    x - 1 = 2 + m/100 or x - 1 = -(2 + m/100)
    x - 1 = -(2 - m/100) or x - 1 = 2 - m/100
Solving each equation gives us four distinct solutions for x in total.

To have exactly 4 distinct solutions, each case must provide exactly 2 solutions. This happens when m/100 is an integer. Hence, m must be a multiple of 100.
Now, we need to determine how many positive integers m satisfy this condition such that m/100 is an integer.
The values of m are 100, 200, 300,… up to the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to 400. Therefore, m can take the values 100, 200, 300, 400.
Thus, there are 4​ positive integers m for which the equation ||x - 1| - 2| = m/100​ has 4 distinct solutions.

This is the incorrect answer. ChatGPT assumed that m/100 must be a positive integer, but the question only specifies that m must be a positive integer. It also randomly assumed that m <= 400.
