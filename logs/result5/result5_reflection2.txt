2) Now assume that this solution is incorrect. List out all the mistakes you made when solving this problem.
3) Solve the problem again, considering the mistakes you found in your original solution.


solution:

1) The problem asks for an increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. This means that each term in the sequence is a multiple of the previous term.

Let's say the first term in the sequence is a and the common ratio is r, the five number sequence would be: a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4.

Firstly, since we are dealing with 2-digit positive integers, a must be a 2-digit number and the common ratio (r) must be a whole number. The second significant point comes from the statement, "There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence". This implies that there is just one set of numbers that fulfills the ‘increasing’ criteria. It also reveals that the common ratio is 1.   

The simplest 2-digit positive integer is 10, and the common ratio in this case is 1. So, the five number sequence is: 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10.

Summing up these integers, we have: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.

2) However, if this solution is incorrect, there could be potential mistakes in interpreting the problem. For example, I assumed the common ratio to be '1' which is not always the case in a geometric sequence. 

3) In light of the potential mistakes, let's re-evaluate the problem. The key here is to determine the sequence that has the fewest 2-digit positive integers, or in other words, the definition of "increasing geometric sequence". 

Here, the term "increasing" implies that each subsequent term is larger than the previous, and thus the common ratio (r) must be greater than 1.

As a result, the lowest possible 2-digit number is 12 because if we choose a lower number, we can't generate a geometric sequence of five 2-digit integers, or in other words, they will exceed 2 digits even with a common ratio of 2.

So taking 'a' as 12, and the common ratio 'r' as 2, the sequence will be: 12, 24, 48, 96, and 192. But the last number 192 is a three-digit integer which contradict our initial requirement.

So let's switch up strategy a little: let's take 'a' as 12 and 'r' as '1.5': 
 
12, 18, 27, 40.5, 60.75, but the last two numbers are not whole numbers, so this is incorrect.

After a number of trials and errors, when we take 'a' as 12 and 'r' as '1.3', we get an increasing sequence of five 2-digit positive integers:
...
12, 15.6 (which rounds off to 16), 20.28 (roughly 20), 26.364 (roughly 26), 34.2732 (roughly 34). 

The sum of these integers is 108. The correct answer should be 108. 


comments:

ChatGPT first solved this problem by assigning the first term as 10 and randomly deciding that the ratio was 1, which goes against a major requirement of the problem.

However, when revising this problem, it was able to catch that mistake and get closer to the right answer. It assigned the common ratio correctly as 1.5 but randomly assigned the first term as 12, which is incorrect, because it means that terms in the sequence are non-integers.
