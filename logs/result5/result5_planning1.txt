solution:

1) Problem to Solve: There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?

2) Solution steps:
Step 1: Define the general formula for a geometric sequence.
Step 2: Set up an equation of the sequence using the parameters given.
Step 3: Identify the conditions the sequence must meet.
Step 4: From these conditions, start with first 2-digit number as 12. Investigate whether or not it can form five increasing 2-digit positive integers in geometric progression.
Step 5: If not, increment the first number by 1 and repeat the process, until the geometric series specified is found.
Step 6: After finding the unique sequence, compute the sum of its terms.

3) Solve the problem:

Step 1: A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. The general formula is a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ..., ar^(n-1) where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

Step 2: From the question, our sequence looks like {a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4} and all elements in the sequence must be 2-digit integers.

Step 3: The formula of each term becomes: a, 2a, 4a, 8a and 16a (geometric sequence with common ratio 2, to keep integers). However, all elements must be 2-digit, which means a must be at least 2 and 16a must be less than 100.

Step 4: This gives a range of a between 2 and 6, as 16x7 is already over 100.

Step 5: If a is 2, the sequence is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 with a sum of 62. However, not all terms are 2-digit numbers.
If a is 3, the sequence is 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 with a sum of 93. Here, all terms are 2-digit numbers.
If a is 4, 6, the sequence would have a term that is greater than 99, which is not a 2-digit number.

Step 6: So the unique sequence is 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and the sum is 93.


comments:

This answer is incorrect. The steps made sense; however, ChatGPT decided that there was no solution in which all the terms could be two-digit numbers and ignored that step completely when solving the problem.
