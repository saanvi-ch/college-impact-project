There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?
Solve this problem, then revise your solution.


solution:

A geometric sequence is a sequence where a constant ratio (more than 0) exists between each term and the previous term. Since we're looking for an increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers, we can start by determining the potential first terms and common ratios.

With five terms, the smallest possible first term would be 10 and the largest would be 14, since the fifth term must be less than 100.

If our first term is 10, then the common ratios we can have are 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4. Higher ratios would result in the fifth term exceeding 100.

Allowable first terms and common ratios:
- For first term 10, the ratios could be 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4.
- For first term 11, the ratios could be 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3.
- For first term 12, the ratios could be 1.1 or 1.2.
- For first term 13, the only ratio could be 1.1.
- For first term 14, the ratio of 1.1 is too large as it will result in a fifth term greater than 100.

Testing, we find that the only sequence of five increasing 2-digit integers in geometric progression is produced by the first term 12 and the ratio 1.2. We have 12, 14, 17, 20, 24.

Sum of these numbers: 12 + 14 + 17 + 20 + 24 = 87

Solution Revision:

An increasing geometric sequence requires a constant ratio greater than one. Therefore, to find a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers, we must find a permissible first term and common ratio. 

Given that the lowest first term is 10 and the highest 14 (with the fifth term still being a 2-digit number), testing with various ratios reveals that the unique sequence is generated with a first term of 12 and a common ratio of 1.2. The sequence we obtain is 12, 14, 17, 20, 24.

Summing these numbers gives us a final sum of 87. Thus, the sum of the unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers is 87.


comments:

This answer is incorrect. ChatGPT made its first mistake when it assumed that the first term must be between 10 & 14, which isn't true (I used 16 for the first term to get the right solution). It then assigned the first term as 12 and the ratio as 1.2, though this would result in non-integer terms. It simply rounded the terms instead of finding a ratio that would produce a sequence of all integers.

In regards to reflection, ChatGPT didn't find anything wrong with its original solution. It simply summarized its original answer.

In the next trial, I'll ask ChatGPT to assume its original answer was wrong to see if it finds any mistakes.
