Prompt:

Solve this problem:
There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?

A well known mathematician suggests that $1 < r < 2$.

Answer:

    A geometric sequence has the form a*r^n where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number. 

    The problem states that we are working with a 5-term increasing geometric sequence of 2-digit integer numbers i.e. a, a*r, a*r^2, a*r^3, and a*r^4.

    We know that the minimum two-digit integer number is 10, and the maximum two-digit integer number is 99. Therefore, for the five terms of the sequence, we have:

    10 ≤ a < 20 (since a*r must also be a two-digit number, we can assume that a should be less than 20 - otherwise, a*r will move to 3-digits)

    10 ≤ a*r < 100 (this must be a two-digit number)

    10 ≤ a*r^2 < 100 (this must also be a two-digit number)

    10 ≤ a*r^3 < 100 (this must also be a two-digit number)

    10 ≤ a*r^4 ≤ 99 (since this is the last term it could be as high as 99)

    Given that 'a' is a two-digit number and 'r' is between 1 and 2, these five inequalities suggest that a reasonable guess for the common ratio might be roughly √2 (around 1.41), and hence a might be between 10 and 20.

    By trying a = 12, one can manually check that a, a*r, a*r^2, a*r^3, and a*r^4 are all two digit numbers for r = √2. This implies that the unique sequence is 12, 17, 24, 34, 48.

    So, the sum of these numbers is 12 + 17 + 24 + 34 + 48 = 135.

Comments:

Even with the hint, ChatGPT assigned r to the wrong value because it didn't take into account the condition that every number in the sequence must be an integer. It also randomly assigned a to 12.
