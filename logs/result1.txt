Solve this problem:

Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?

To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

First, we know the parabola

y=kx

 −2kx+l intersects the line 
y

y=4 at points

A and 
B
B. Therefore, we have:

kx

 −2kx+l=4
which simplifies to:

(

=

kx

 −2kx+(l−4)=0
Let the roots of this equation be 
x

  and 
x

 . Then, by Vieta's formulas, we have:

Given that 
A

∣x

 −x

 ∣=6
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from 
A
A and 
B
B to the origin. The distance from any point 
(

(x,4) on the line 
y
=

y=4 to the origin is given by 
x

Thus, the squares of the distances are:

Adding

Therefore, the answer is
