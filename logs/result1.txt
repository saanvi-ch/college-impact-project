Solve this problem:
Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?

Answer:

Before the response pasted below, ChatGPT created equations for the roots of kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0, the sum of these roots, the distance between these roots, and the distances OA and OB (these distance equations were incorrect). However, it did not provide an answer until I asked "what's the answer," to which it responded with this:

  Let's summarize and find the final answer step by step:

  Given:
    The parabola y = kx^2 − 2kx + l intersects the line y = 4 at points A and B.
    These points are 6 units apart along the line y = 4.
    We need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin.

  Intersection Points Calculation: The parabola intersects y = 4, so:
    kx^2 − 2kx + l = 4
    This gives us x_1​ and x_2​ as the roots of the quadratic equation kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0

  Distance Calculation: The distance between A and B is given as 6 units along the y = 4 line

  Sum of Squares of Distances: We need to find OA^2 + OB^2, where O is the origin.

  Since the exact values of k and l are not provided and are not needed for finding OA^2 + OB^2, the sum of squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is directly related to the geometric properties of the problem:
  52

Comments:

This is the correct answer, but there's no explanation as to how it derived the answer from the formulas it created. If the sum and distance formulas are used to create a system of equations, the points A & B, and therefore the answer, can be found.

The way I solved it was by finding the x-value of the parabola's vertex by using the formula x = -b/2a, which gave me 1 for x. Because the points A & B on the line y = 4 must be equidistant from the line of symmetry (x = 1) I found the x values by adding/subtracting 3 from 1 because the distance between the points A & B is 6. This meant that the two points were (-2,4) & (4,4) so I could find the distances from the origin, square them, and add them to get 52.
However, this only works if the line that the parabola intersects is horizontal.
