Prompt:

Solve this problem:
Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.

A well-known mathematician suggests following these steps:
1. find the probability that all the dice will roll a number from 1 to 5.
2. find the probability that all the dice will roll a number from 1 to 4.
3. Subtract (2) from (1) to get $a/b$. simplify the fraction so that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.
4. find $a + b$.

Answer:

To find the probability that all dice roll a number from 1 to 5, you consider that for each die there are 5 valid outcomes out of 6 total outcomes. Because the rolls of each die are independent, you calculate the combined probability by multiplying them:

(5/6)^4 = 625/1296

Next, to find the probability that all dice roll a number from 1 to 4, you use the same thinking, but this time there are only 4 valid outcomes for each die:

(4/6)^4 = 256/1296 

Now, to find the probability that the highest roll is a 5, you subtract the second probability from the first:

625/1296 - 256/1296 = 369/1296

However, 369 and 1296 are not relatively prime, as they share the common factors 3 and 123, so you simplify the fraction:

369/1296 = 123/432 = 41/144

And finally, to find a + b, you add the two remaining numbers:

41 + 144 = 185.

So 185 is your answer.
