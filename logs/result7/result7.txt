Solve this problem:
Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.

Answer:

To find the probability that the highest roll among four fair 6-sided dice is a 5, we need to count the favorable outcomes where at least one die shows a 5 as the highest roll.

Step 1: Total Number of Outcomes
Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice is: 6^4 = 1296

Step 2: Favorable Outcomes
We will use the complementary counting method to find the number of outcomes where no die shows a 5 as the highest roll.
Case Analysis:
    Case 1:
        No die shows a 5.
        All dice show numbers from 1 to 4.
        Each die has 4 possible outcomes.
        The number of outcomes for this case: 4^4 = 256
    Case 2: 
        At least one die shows a 5.
        Calculate this by subtracting the outcomes from Case 1 from the total outcomes: 1296 - 256 = 1040

Step 3: Probability Calculation
The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 1040/1296​

Step 4: Simplify the Fraction
To simplify 1040/1296​, find the greatest common divisor of 1040 and 1296, which is 16: 65/81

Step 5: Verify that 65 and 81 are Relatively Prime
Since 65 and 81 have no common divisors other than 1, they are relatively prime.

Step 6: Sum a+ba + ba+b
We have a = 65 and b = 81. Therefore, a + b = 65 + 81 = 146​

Comments:

This answer is incorrect. ChatGPT incorrectly calculated the probability by not accounting for the fact that none of the rolls can result in the number 6.

I solved this problem by finding the probability that all dice would roll a number 1-5 (5^4/6^4 = 625/1296) and the probability that all the dice would roll a number 1-4 (4^4/6^4 = 256/1296). Then I subtracted the second value from the first to get 369/1296, which becomes 41/144 when simplified. a + b = 185.

Answer with gpt-4:

    To find the probability that the highest roll is a 5, we need to think about what possible outcomes can occur. 

    We’ll break it down into cases based on how many dice rolled a 5.

    1. One die rolled a 5:
    The other three dice can roll any number from 1 to 4. So there are $5 * (4^3)$ ways for this to happen.

    2. Two dice rolled a 5:
    The other two dice can roll any number from 1 to 4. So there are ${4 \choose 2} * (4^2)$ ways for this to happen.

    3. Three dice rolled a 5:
    The other one die can roll any number from 1 to 4. So there are ${4 \choose 3} * 4$ ways for this to happen.

    4. All four dice rolled a 5:
    This can only happen in one way.


    The total number of ways for all these cases to occur is $5 * (4^3) + {4 \choose 2} * (4^2) + {4 \choose 3} * 4 + 1 = 80 + 384 + 48 + 1 = 513$.

    And the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four dice is $6^4 = 1296$.

    Therefore, the probability the highest roll is a 5 is $513/1296$, but $513$ and $1296$ are not relatively prime. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, $3$, gives us the simplified fraction $171/432$.

    Finally, asking for $a + b$, we get $171 + 432 = 603$.
