Prompt:

Solve this problem:
Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.

A well-known mathematician suggests finding the probabilities that the dice will all roll a certain range of numbers and then subtracting them.


Answer:

To find the probability that the highest roll is a 5, we approach as follows:

The total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided fair dice is 6^4 or 1296.

Next, you can consider the number of ways each die can roll between 5 and 1 delineating the maximum roll as 5. 

There is exactly 1 way to get a 5 for a given die and 5 ways to get a number between 1 and 5 inclusive. Therefore, each die can roll in 5 ways out of 6, where the 5 is the maximum number rolled. Hence there are 5^4 or 625 distinct outcomes where the maximum roll is 5.

However, the condition where the highest roll is 5, we must subtract out the cases where the maximum roll is 4. This would be having each die roll in 4 ways out of 6, where the number 4 is the maximum roll. Hence, there are 4^4 or 256 distinct outcomes where the maximum roll is 4.

So the number of outcomes where the maximum roll is 5 is 625 - 256 = 369. 

The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is then 369/1296 = 41/144, where 41 and 144 are relative primes.

Finally, find a + b: 41 + 144 = 185. 

So the solution to the problem is 185.
