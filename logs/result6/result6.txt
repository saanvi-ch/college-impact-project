Solve this problem:
For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?

Answer:

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation:
||x - 1| - 2| = m/100

This equation suggests that |x - 1| - 2 = m/100 or |x - 1| - 2 = -m/100
    Case 1: |x - 1| - 2 = m/100
    |x - 1| = 2 + m/100
    Case 2: |x - 1| - 2 = -m/100
    |x - 1| = 2 - m/100

Each case results in two equations:
    x - 1 = 2 + m/100 or x - 1 = -(2 + m/100)
    x - 1 = -(2 - m/100) or x - 1 = 2 - m/100
Solving each equation gives us four distinct solutions for x in total.

To have exactly 4 distinct solutions, each case must provide exactly 2 solutions. This happens when m/100 is an integer. Hence, m must be a multiple of 100.
Now, we need to determine how many positive integers m satisfy this condition such that m/100 is an integer.
The values of m are 100, 200, 300,… up to the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to 400. Therefore, m can take the values 100, 200, 300, 400.
Thus, there are 4​ positive integers m for which the equation ||x - 1| - 2| = m/100​ has 4 distinct solutions.

Comments:

This is the incorrect answer. ChatGPT assumed that m/100 must be a positive integer, but the question only specifies that m must be a positive integer. It also randomly assumed that m <= 400.

I solved it by splitting the absolute value into four equations, eliminating m = 0 and m = 200, and then plugging the solutions back in to find that 1 <= m <= 199. Therefore there are 199 solutions.

Answer with gpt-4:

    In simple English, the question is asking for how many values of m there will be exactly 4 distinct x solutions to the equation | |x - 1| - 2 | = m/100.

    Let's break this up and solve it step by step:

    Firstly, let's understand the expression |x - 1|. This expression results in the absolute difference between x and 1. So, if we then subtract 2 from this absolute difference, the outcomes can be both negative and non-negative depending on the value of x.

    We have that |x - 1| - 2 is equal to:
    - (x - 1 - 2) = (x - 3) for x >= 3
    - -(x - 1 - 2) = -(x - 3) = 3 - x for 1 <= x < 3
    - -(1 - x - 2) = -(3 - x) = x - 3 for x < 1

    The absolute value of these three cases then is:
    - |x - 3| for x >= 3
    - |3 - x| for 1 <= x < 3
    - |x - 3| for x < 1

    Now we have pieces of information about x for three different ranges that are defined by the piecewise function: |x - 3| for x not in [1, 3] and |3 - x| for x in [1, 3].

    Any absolute value equation has either 0, 2 or an infinite number of solutions. 

    But when we take the absolute value of |x - 3| or |3 - x| we get the equation | |x - 3| | = m/100 or | |3 - x| | = m/100, which can also have 0, 2 or an infinite number of solutions.

    So, if m/100 = 0, each equation has one solution which mean total 2 solutions.

    If 0 < m/100 < 2, | |x - 3| | = m/100 has two solutions and | |3 - x| | = m/100 has two solutions. This will mean total 4 solutions. 
    ...

    We want to find the number of m for which there are total 4 solutions. This is only possible when 0 < m/100 < 2. We can multiply through by 100 to find the number of positive integers m that satisfy 0 < m < 200.

    So there are 200 - 1 = 199 such possible values of m. Therefore, there are 199 values of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions (for x).
