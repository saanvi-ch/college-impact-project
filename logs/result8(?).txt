Solve this problem:
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?

Answer:

The equation given is:
((∣x + y∣ − 10)^2 + (∣x − y∣ − 10)^2)((∣x∣ − 8)^2 + (∣y∣ − 8)^2) = 0
This equation indicates that one of the factors must be zero because the product of two non-negative terms is zero only when one of them is zero.
Analyzing the factors:

Factor 1:
    (∣x + y∣ − 10)^2 + (∣x − y∣ − 10)^2 = 0
    This implies: ∣x + y∣ = 10 and ∣x − y∣ = 10
    These equations describe lines x + y = 10, x + y = −10, x − y = 10, x − y = −10

Factor 2:
    (∣x∣ − 8)^2 + (∣y∣ − 8)^2 = 0
    This implies: ∣x∣ = 8 and ∣y∣ = 8
    These equations describe lines x = 8, x = −8, y = 8, y = −8

Finding intersection points:
To find the vertices of the convex polygon, we need to find the intersection points of the lines described by the above equations.

Vertices of the convex polygon:
The intersection points are found at the following coordinates: (8,0), (−8,0), (0,8), (0,−8), (10,0), (−10,0), (0,10), (0,−10)
These points form a regular octagon centered at the origin, with vertices at distances 8 units from the origin and 10 units from the origin.

Calculating the area of the octagon:
To find the area of the regular octagon, we can use the formula for the area of a regular octagon given its side length s:
Area = 2(1 + √2)s^2
Here, s = 8 (since the vertices are 8 units from the origin).
Substituting s = 8, Area = 128(1 + √2)

Comments:

This is the incorrect answer. ChatGPT simplified the function wrong and got the wrong equations (I got x = 10, x = -10, y = 10, y = -10, y = x + 16, y = x - 16, y = -x + 16, y = -x - 16). It then found the wrong points of intersection (these points were wrong even for the equations it created). It then used the formula for the area of a regular octagon, but the polygon created isn't a regular octagon.

I solved by making the absolute value function into a piecewise function and then finding the intersection points and graphing the polygon. I then found the area. However, I got the answer 368 instead of 320.
