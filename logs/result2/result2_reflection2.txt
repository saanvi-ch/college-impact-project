prompt:

Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?

solution:

We will solve this problem using the principles of mod 9 arithmetic. As we know, any number and the sum of its digits are equivalent mod 9. This also implies that the sum of the digits of a number and the sum of the digits of the sum of two numbers are equivalent mod 9.

In this problem, it is given that a yellow number plus another yellow number is equal to a blue number. This implies that double the sum of the digits of any yellow number has to be equivalent to the sum of the digits of some blue number mod 9.

Since any number can have a digit sum from 1 to 27 (for these 3 digit numbers), the possible digit sums for yellow numbers have to be from 1 to 4 (as doubling these gives values from 2 to 8) and 5 (double of 5 is 10, which is 1 mod 9). The remaining values 6, 7, 8, and 9 (or 0 mod 9) can be given to blue numbers.

Now, we distribute the 9 possible digit sums 1-9 (or 0-8 mod 9) among yellow and blue numbers. We can easily see that yellow numbers can have a digit sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 while blue numbers can have a digit sum of 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

We can distribute the numbers of different digit sums in the following way:

1) The number of three-digit numbers whose digit sum is 1 is 1 (i.e., 100). This has to be yellow.
2) The number of three-digit numbers whose digit sum is 2 is 4 (i.e., 110, 101, 200, 020). Again, these are yellow.
3) For a digit sum of 3, there are 10 such numbers (e.g., 300, 030, 003, 111, 120, 102, 210, 201, 012, 021). All these are yellow.
4 and 5) For digit sums of 4 and 5, we have 20 and 31 numbers respectively. These are yellow.
6, 7, 8, 9) For digit sums of 6, 7, 8, and 9, we have 44, 60, 75, and 92 numbers respectively. All these are blue.

We add up all the yellow numbers to get the required solution:
1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 31 = 66

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 66.

Let's say this solution is incorrect because the assumption used in creating sets of numbers having sum of digits from 1 to 9 is not valid. We used this incorrectly for dividing into yellow and blue numbers. Let's revise the solution.
...

We add up all the yellow numbers to get the required solution:
Number of yellow numbers = 1 (for digit sum = 1) + 4 (for digit sum = 2) + 20 (for digit sum = 4) = 25.
Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 25 with the revised approach of the solution.

This answer is incorrect. ChatGPT isn't getting closer to the answer, so trying the reflection method on a different problem might get better results.
