Prompt:

Solve this problem:
Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?

A well-known mathematician suggests first assigning the numbers $500$ to $999$ inclusive as blue numbers.

Answer:

The mathematician's suggestion to assign the numbers $500$ to $999$ as blue numbers certainly makes sense, as it gives a large range of possible sums. Any two yellow numbers must sum to a blue number. Since the largest possible sum of two three-digit numbers is $1998$, any number greater than this must be blue. Therefore, at least $499$ numbers must be blue.

Then we consider the numbers $111$ to $499$. Any pair of these numbers has a sum that is at most $998 (499 + 499)$. Therefore, all of these numbers can be yellow. So, we can have a maximum of $499 - 111 + 1 = 389$ yellow numbers. 

This is because yellow numbers are allowed to sum to each other as well as to blue numbers. For example, if we had four yellow numbers $a, b, c$, and $d$, and the sums $a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d$ were all yellow numbers or blue numbers, then all four could be yellow. So, unlike blue numbers, yellow numbers are not ruled out by being sums of other yellow numbers.

So, the answer is $389$.

Comments:

This answer is incorrect. ChatGPT didn't consider that the numbers 111-249 can't be yellow because their sums wouldn't be blue.
