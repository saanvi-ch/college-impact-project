Prompt:

Solve this problem:
Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?

A well-known mathematician suggests to follow these steps:

1. Find the vertex of the parabola.
2. Note that the vertex is the midpoint of the segment $AB$.
3. Use (1) and (2) to find the x coordinate of $A$ and $B$.
4. Use (3) along with the fact that the y-coordiante of $A$ and $B$ is 4 to find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
5. Finish the problem with the distance formula

Answer:

Here is a step-by-step solution for the problem:

1) The vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. Here, a = k and b = -2k, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\frac{-2k}{2k} = 1$.

2) Since the vertex is the midpoint of segment AB, and the x-coordinates of A and B are equally distant from 1, we can denote A as (1-d, 4) and B as (1+d, 4), where d is the distance from the vertex to a point (either A or B).

3) Since the distance between A and B is given as 6, the x-coordinate difference is 6, which gives $2d=6$ and hence $d=3$. So, the coordinates of A and B are A = (1-3, 4) = (-2, 4) and B = (1+3, 4) = (4, 4).

4) Now we have the coordinates of A and B.

5) We finish the problem using the distance formula, which states that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) is $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. So, the distance from A to the origin is $\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20}$ and the distance from B to the origin is $\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{32}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is then $\sqrt{20}^2 + \sqrt{32}^2 = 20 + 32 = 52$.
