      "\n",
      "1) The vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Here, a = k and b = -2k, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\\frac{-2k}{2k} = 1$.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Since the vertex is the midpoint of segment AB, and the x-coordinates of A and B are equally distant from 1, we can denote A as (1-d, 4) and B as (1+d, 4), where d is the distance from the vertex to a point (either A or B).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Since the distance between A and B is given as 6, the x-coordinate difference is 6, which gives $2d=6$ and hence $d=3$. So, the coordinates of A and B are A = (1-3, 4) = (-2, 4) and B = (1+3, 4) = (4, 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Now we have the coordinates of A and B.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) We finish the problem using the distance formula, which states that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. So, the distance from A to the origin is $\\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{20}$ and the distance from B to the origin is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{32}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is then $\\sqrt{20}^2 + \\sqrt{32}^2 = 20 + 32 = 52$.\n"
