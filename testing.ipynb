      "1) Here's the problem statement: \"There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Here are the steps to take to solve this problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "   a) Understand the problem: a geometric sequence is a sequence where every term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number (let's call it 'r').\n",
      "\n",
      "   b) Consider the constraints: terms must be 2-digit positive integers. This gives limits for the smallest and largest possible terms in our sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "   c) Determine the first term: this will be in the range of 10 to 99, but due to our constraints and sequence requirements, it can only be a certain number.\n",
      "\n",
      "   d) Identify the common ratio (r).\n",
      "\n",
      "   e) Apply these values (first term and r) in the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence: Sum = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1) where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Now let's solve the problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "   a) Understand the problem: an increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers.\n",
      "\n",
      "   b) Considering the constraints, the first term must be as small as possible to allow for the sequence to 'fit' within the 2-digit range. So, it’s reasonable to start with the smallest 2-digit positive integer, 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "   c) Since we’re talking about an increasing geometric sequence, the ratio (r) will be greater than 1. Also, the ratio must be an integer because every term of the sequence must be an integer. We think through some reasonable values for r (like 2, 3, etc.) but we quickly find that these would make the sequence exceed two-digits. Therefore, the ratio must be less than 2 but more than 1. After trying a few candidates, we find that the ratio can be '1', in a case where the sequence is constant, i.e., not increasing. Since the problem statement specifies an increasing sequence, we pick 'r' = 1.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "   d) Now we have the first term ('a' = 10) and the common ratio ('r' = 1.5). We can now apply these values to the formula to calculate the sum of the sequence. The number of terms ('n') is given as 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "   e) Inserting these into the sum formula: Sum = 10 * (1.5^5 - 1) / (1.5 - 1) = 187.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the sum we calculated is not an integer, which contradicts with the condition that all our terms had to be integers. This occurs because we made an oversight in selecting the common ratio as 1.5. When this is applied, while the second term is still an integer (15), the following terms won't be integers anymore. Therefore, our original approach must be flawed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This doesn't typically happen in well-set math problems, but when it does, you'll need to review your assumptions. On revisiting our understanding, we realize that the ratio doesn't need to be an integer. For example, √2 is a possible ratio and all terms would still be integer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's now try the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The geometric sequence must look like this: a, a*r, a*r^2, a*r^3, a*r^4, where \"a\" is the first term and \"r\" is the common ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that r must be greater than 1 (since it's an increasing sequence) and that the first and last terms must be two-digit numbers. If we make a an integer and r the square root of an integer, every term in the sequence will be an integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a bit of trial and error, we find that a good fit would be a=12 and r=√2. This will give us the sequence 12, 17, 24, 34, 48, all of which are 2-digit integers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the sum can be calculated as Sum = 12 + 17 + 24 + 34 + 48 = 135.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) The solution is `Sum = 135`, where the terms are an increasing geometric sequence, all of which are 2-digit integers. Hence, the solution meets all the requirements of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revision: No revision is needed as the solution correctly meets all the conditions given in the problem. The final answer is 135. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please note, this problem demanded an understanding of geometric sequence and a fair amount of educated guessing. Different approaches may lead to the same correct result. Despite the initial error in the common ratio selection, the problem provided a good illustration on the importance of reviewing and readjusting assumptions when solving elaborate math problems. \n"
