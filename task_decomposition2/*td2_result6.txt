To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Start by considering the nature of the modulus function. Realize that the function's graph will "break" wherever the interior equals zero.
2. Practically, find where the function x - 1 and -(x - 1) equal zero. 
3. Similarly, find when |x - 1| - 2 and -(|x - 1| - 2) equal zero as well.
4. Use the points you found to split the function into different regions.
5. Draw the lines corresponding to each region and see that the number of intersections is directly related to the value of 'm' and the number of solutions.
6. For every region, the line y = m/100 when intersected with the graph can give 0, 1 or 2 solutions for the corresponding range of m. 
7. Try to find the range of the 'm' that gives exactly four integer solutions.
8. Once the ranges of 'm' are determined, count the number of positive integers in these ranges. This can be done by subtracting the bounds and then rounding if necessary, because m is an integer.
9. The result should be the number of positive integer values of m.

Firstly, let's find where the function breaks. That is when:

- x - 1 = 0, giving x = 1
- -(x - 1) = 0, which still gives x = 1
- |x - 1| - 2 = 0, which gives x = 3 and x = -1
- -(|x - 1| - 2) = 0, which also gives x = 3 and x = -1

So the function breaks at x = -1, x = 1 and x = 3. These points divide the x-axis into four regions:

- x < -1
- -1 < x < 1
- 1 < x < 3
- x > 3

Next, we need to study the function in these regions:

- For x < -1, the function is 3 - x, which is a line with a negative slope.
- For -1 < x < 1, the function is 2 - |x - 1|, which gives a V shape with minimum at x = 1.
- For 1 < x < 3, the function again is |x - 1| - 2, which is a V shaped graph with minimum at x = 1.
- For x > 3, the function is x - 3, which is a line with a positive slope.

Now, notice that for every region, the line y = m/100 when intersected with the graph can give 0, 1 or 2 solutions for the corresponding value of m. 

We are interested in finding the 'm' values that would give us exactly 4 integer solutions, that is 2 integer solutions in two different regions.

From the graph, we can conclude that:

- In the region x < -1, the graph intersects the y-axis at 3, so the possible m values ranging from 300 to infinity (not inclusive) can give 2 integer solutions. 
- In the region -1 < x < 1, the graph fluctuates between 1 and 2, so it can give 2 integer solution for m values ranging from 100 to 200 (not inclusive).
- In the region 1 < x < 3, the graph fluctuates between 0 and 1, so it can provide 2 integer solution for m values ranging from 0 to 100.
- In the region x > 3, the graph intersects the y-axis at 3, similar to the first region the m values ranging from 300 to infinity (not inclusive).

From these regions, 

- For m values between 100 and 200, we have 2 integer solutions from region -1 < x < 1. Then, if we choose m values between 300 to infinity (not inclusive), we get 2 more integer solution from region x > 3. So our possible m values lies in the intersection which is [300, 200), which doesn't contain any integers.
- If we choose m values between 0 to 100, region 1 < x < 3 will give us 2 integer solutions. In order to gain 2 more integer solutions, m values should be between 300 to infinity (not inclusive) from region x > 3. This intersection again gives empty set.

So, the only possibility is in m values within 300 to infinity (not inclusive) which is from the region x < -1 as well as x > 3. Hence, the integer values for m can start from 301 (302, 303, .... ). 

So the values m can take are exactly not countable because it runs from 301 to infinity, which leads to indefinitely many values.

The solution process is correct, but the final answer is incorrect. The calculator considered the m values that have more than 4 solutions (considering the regions x < -1 and x > 3 at the same time). The problem is asking for m values that have exactly 4 solutions. The calculator should consider the m values for each region separately and then find the intersection of m values between these regions giving exactly 4 solutions, instead of considering regions that would lead to m values giving more than 4 solutions. The error is in the calculator's approach to finding the range of 'm' values. Please recalculate considering the regions separately.

Indeed, the error in the previous calculation was due to considering the regions that could provide more than 4 solutions instead of exactly 4.

Let's consider the four regions separately: 

1. For x < -1, the function is 3 - x. This line will intersect y = m/100 at two different integer x values for m/100 in the range (2,3). Hence m can take values from 201 to 299 inclusive (99 values).

2. For -1 < x < 1, the function is 2 - |x - 1|. This V-shaped graph will intersect y = m/100 at two different integer x values for m/100 in the range (1,2). Hence m can take values from 101 to 199 inclusive (99 values).

3. For 1 < x < 3, the function again is |x - 1| - 2, but this time it intersects y = m/100 at two different integer x values for 0 < m/100 < 1. Hence m can take values from 1 to 99 inclusive (99 values).

4. As discussed above, for x > 3, the function is x - 3. This is similar to the line 3 - x for x < -1. Hence, this line will intersect y = m/100 at two different integer x values for m/100 in the range (2,3), but we have already considered these values (99 values).

We need m values that will give us exactly 4 solutions. This would mean that we need two intersections in two different regions. 

- Pairing region 1 (with m values from 201 to 299) with region 2 (with m values from 101 to 199) doesn't yield common m values.
- Pairing regions 1 (with m values from 201 to 299) and 3 (with m values from 1 to 99) also doesn't yield common m values.

This leaves us with pairing regions 2 and 3, which together provide m values ranging from 101 to 199, yielding a total of 99 m values that give the equation exactly 4 integer solutions.

So, the answer is 99.

This answer is incorrect. So far, this model has produced even fewer correct results than the original, even though it's running more properly. Maybe the revision situation isn't good enough.
