This problem combines the concepts of probability with statistics. The correct way to approach this problem is as follows:

1. Understand that a 6-sided die gives equal probability to all numbers and that independent events are being considered (i.e., each dice roll does not affect other rolls).

2. When the problem is asking for the highest roll to be 5, it means that no roll can equal 6, but they can equal 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. Think about the two separate conditions for the dice: it rolled a number between 1-5, or it rolled a 6.

4. Calculate the total possible outcomes using the sample space. In this case, there's a total of 6 options for each of the 4 dice, so there are a total of 6^4 possible outcomes.

5. Calculate the desired outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This would mean the dice can be any value from 1-5, so there is a total of 5^4 outcomes that meet the first condition.

6. Calculate the desired outcomes where no 6's are rolled. Subtract the number of ways no 6 could appear (which is 5^4) from total possible outcomes (which is 6^4).

7. The probability of this event is desired outcomes divided by total outcomes. This step will require simplifying the fraction to its most simplified form, yielding $a/b$.

8. To get $a + b$, you would add the simplified a and b values.

9. The solution is this resultant sum.

1. Understand that each die roll is an independent event and all six faces have an equal probability of appearing.

2. Understand that no roll can be 6. All rolls must be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to fit the condition.

3. The two conditions for the dice roll are: it rolled a number between 1 and 5, or it rolled a 6.

4. The total potential outcomes for four dice rolls are 6^4, or 1296.

5. The outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 are 5^4, or 625. 

6. The outcomes where there are no 6's rolled would be 1296 - 625 = 671.

7. The probability of this event happening is 671 out of 1296 so the fraction is 671/1296.

8. To get $a/b$, we need to reduce 671/1296 to lowest terms. Using greatest common factor (GCF) of 671 and 1296, we find that the GCF is 1. So, the simplified form of the fraction remains 671/1296.

9. To find $a+b$, we just add 671 and 1296, which results in 1967.

10. So, the solution to this problem is 1967.

The solution is incorrect. The error lies in the approach of calculating the desired outcomes where the highest roll is 5. The desired outcomes were calculated as 5^4, which is not correct because it includes conditions where all dice are 4 or less and the highest roll is not 5. The problem requires the highest roll to be exactly 5, so conditions with highest roll less than 5 should not be included. The problem should be solved again with correct understanding of the conditions.

Statistical Analyst, please calculate the right number of desired outcomes which includes conditions where the highest roll is exactly 5. Subtract such number from the number of outcomes where the dice rolled any number between 1-5 which is 5^4. The rest of the calculation can follow the same process as before.

1. Understand that the dice rolls are independent events and all faces have equal probability.

2. Understand that you want the highest roll to be a 5, so no roll can be a 6, and at least one roll has to be a 5. Other rolls can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The two conditions for the dice roll are: it rolled a number between 1 and 5, or it rolled a 6.

4. The total potential outcomes for four dice rolls are 6^4, or 1296.

5. Calculate the outcomes where all the rolls are between 1 and 4. There are 4 options for each of the 4 dice. So there will be 4^4 = 256 such outcomes.

6. The number of satisfactory outcomes where the dice rolled a number between 1-5 and at least one roll is a 5, would be the total outcomes where dice rolled a number between 1-5 (which is 5^4 or 625) minus the outcomes where all the rolls are between 1 and 4 (which is 256). So, 625 - 256 = 369.

7. The probability of these satisfactory outcomes is 369 divided by the total potential outcomes 1296. So the fraction is 369 / 1296.

8. The next step is to simplify 369 / 1296 to its lowest terms to get $a / b$.

9. Once you have $a / b$ in its lowest terms, add the numerator $a$ and the denominator $b$ to get $a + b$.

10. The solution is this $a + b$ sum.

1. Understand that each die roll is an independent event and all six faces have an equal probability of appearing.

2. Understand that to fit the problem's conditions, no roll can be 6, and at least one roll has to be a 5. The rest of the rolls can be any value from 1 to 5.

3. The two possibilities for each dice roll are: it rolled a number between 1 and 5, or it rolled a 6.

4. Calculate the total possible outcomes. Since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 4 dice rolls, there are 6^4, or 1296, total possible outcomes.

5. Calculate the outcomes where all the rolls are between 1 and 4. Since there are 4 options for each of the 4 dice, these outcomes total 4^4, or 256.

6. To find the number of outcomes where the dice rolled a number between 1-5 and the highest roll is exactly 5, subtract the number of outcomes where all the rolls are between 1 and 4 (which is 256) from the total possible outcomes of rolls between 1 and 5 (which is 5^4, or 625). So, the number of desired outcomes is 625 - 256 = 369.

7. The probability of the desired outcomes is then 369 divided by the total possible outcomes 1296. So the fraction is 369/1296.

8. We must simplify the fraction 369/1296 to its simplest terms to get $a/b$. The greatest common divisor of 369 and 1296 is 9. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 9 gives the simplified fraction 41/144.

9. Therefore, $a + b$ in the fraction $a/b$ = 41/144 is 41 + 144 = 185.

10. Thus, the solution to the problem is 185.

The solution is correct. The initially wrong calculation for the desired outcomes where the highest roll is exactly 5 was corrected. The steps and calculations taken in the solution meet the requirements of the problem conditions correctly. The solution correctly identifies that the answer to the problem is 185. TERMINATE
