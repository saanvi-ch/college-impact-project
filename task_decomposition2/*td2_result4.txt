1. Since this is an optimization problem, we will need to take derivatives at some point. However, with the absolute value function in our constraint, taking derivatives directly would complicate things. So, let's start by writing the constraint in another way, which hopefully will be easier to work with.

2. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be written, considering the eight possible combinations of the sign of the absolute value, as four separate systems of equations simplifying the issue: 
    (i) $x-2y + y-2x = 40$
    (ii) $x-2y - (y-2x) = 40$
    (iii) $-(x-2y) + y-2x = 40$
    (iv) $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$

3. Solve each of these four systems of equations to find possible x and y values. Ensure that solutions are real numbers only. 

4. Once you get the solutions, substitute each solution into your main function, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to evaluate their values. 

5. The lowest result you obtain from these substitutions will be the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint.

1. Rewrite the equation as follows: 
The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be written as four separate systems of equations:

(i) $x-2y + y-2x = 40$ which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$
(ii) $x-2y - (y-2x) = 40$ which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$
(iii) $-(x-2y) + y-2x = 40$ which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$
(iv) $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$ which simplifies to $x + y = 40$

2. Solve these equations: 
(i) The solution for the first equation is $x = -40 - y$, the solution for the second equation is $x = 40/3 + y$, solution for the third equation is $x = y - 40/3$ and solution for the last equation is $x = 40 - y$

3. Substituting these solutions into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to evaluate their values, we get:

(i) $5(-40 - y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(-40 - y)y$
(ii) $5(40/3 + y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(40/3 + y)y$
(iii) $5(y - 40/3)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(y - 40/3)y$
(iv) $5(40 - y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(40 - y)y$

4. Evaluating these expressions we find:

(i) $3400 + 200y + 10y^2$
(ii) $1800 + 240/3y + 10/3y^2$
(iii) $1800 - 240/3y + 10/3y^2$
(iv) $3400 - 200y + 10y^2$

5. The lowest value from these evaluations would give the minimum value of the original function given the constraint. We can tell that the second and third equations will give a negative value because of the second term in the equations. But we need to find the exact minimum. The derivative of the second and third expressions with respect to y are both 0 when $y = 12$.

So the minimum value reached in these expressions is when $y = 12$, for the second and third equation, 

(ii) $1800 + 240/3*12 + 10/3*12^2 = 4320$
(iii) $1800 - 240/3*12 + 10/3*12^2 = 4320$

So, the minimum values of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint equation is $4320$.

The solution calculates correctly until the point where the solution for the four systems is found: 

(i) $x = -40 - y$ 
(ii) $x = 40/3 + y$
(iii) $x = y - 40/3$
(iv) $x = 40 - y$

However, from step 3 onwards, the solution includes calculation errors. Specifically, the substitution of these into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get four expressions is incorrect, as is the claim that the derivatives of the second and third expressions are both 0 when $y = 12$. Additionally, solving for $y$ from the second and third expressions provides incorrect results for $y$. 

Please solve the problem again from step 3 onwards.

Apologies for the confusion. Letâ€™s try again from step 3 onwards:

1. Substituting the solutions from step 2 into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:

(i) Substituting $x = -40 - y$ into the original, we get $5(-40 - y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(-40 - y)y$
(ii) Substituting $x = 40/3 + y$ into the original, we get $5(40/3 + y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(40/3 + y)y$
(iii) Substituting $x = y - 40/3$ into the original, we get $5(y - 40/3)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(y - 40/3)y$
(iv) Substituting $x = 40 - y$ into the original, we get $5(40 - y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(40 - y)y$

2. Simplifying this gives us:

(i) $y^2 + 40y + 700$
(ii) $y^2 - 80y/3 + 2600/3$
(iii) $y^2 + 80y/3 + 2600/3$
(iv) $y^2 - 40y + 700$

3. Upon observing the simplified equations, The minimum value of a quadratic function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $y = c - \frac{b^2}{4a}$. The four simplified equations will reach the minimum value when $y = -\frac{b}{2a}$. Solve for $y$ in these equations:

(i) $y = -\frac{40 }{2 }= -20$
(ii) $y = \frac{80 }{6 }= 40/3$
(iii) $y = -\frac{80 }{6 }= -40/3$
(iv) $y = \frac{40 }{2 }= 20$

4. Evaluating these four equations for these respective $y$ values will give us:

(i) $y^2 + 40y + 700 = (-20)^2 -40*(-20) + 700 = 1700$
(ii) $y^2 - 80y/3 + 2600/3 = (40/3)^2 - \frac{80*40}{9} + 2600/3 = 3200/3$
(iii) $y^2 + 80y/3 + 2600/3 = (-40/3)^2 + \frac{80*40}{9} + 2600/3 = 3200/3$
(iv) $y^2 - 40y + 700 = (20)^2 - 40*20 + 700 = 900$

5. The smallest of these values is $900$, so within the given constraint, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $900$.

The solution provided has multiple errors. Specifically, the conversions of the absolute value equations into four separate systems are incorrect. The terms inside the absolute value bars cannot change interchangeably between positive and negative variants. Additionally, the solutions derived from these systems have been incorrectly substituted and evaluated. The derived minimum value does not align with previous statements.

Please retry the whole problem taking into account these errors.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's attempt to solve this problem again:

1. Rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ considering potential combinations:

(i) If $x - 2y > 0$ and $y - 2x > 0$, the equation becomes $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + y = 20$.
(ii) If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x - y = 20$.
(iii) If $x - 2y > 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, the equation becomes $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
(iv) If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x > 0$, the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$.

However, under the following considerations for $x$ and $y$: 

(i) and (ii) cannot be true because in the scenario of (i), $x$ would be less than $2y$, and $y$ would be less than $2x$, which is a contradiction. The same applies to (ii).

Therefore, we will focus on (iii) and (iv). These both simplify to $x = y + 40/3$. 

2. Now we substitute $x = y + 40/3$ back into the original function, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(y + 40/3)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(y + 40/3)y$.

3. Simplify this equation, and we get $28/3 y^2 - 400/3 y + 4000/3$, which is a quadratic function.

4. The minimum of a quadratic function in the form of $f(y) = ay^2 + by + c$ is given by $y = -b/(2*a)$, so here minimum of $f(y)$ is obtained when $y = -(400/3) / (2*28/3) = 50/7$.

5. Substitute $y = 50/7$ back into the simplified function, which will give the minimum value of the original function:

$f(50/7) = 28/3 * (2500/49) - 400/3 * (50/7) + 4000/3 = 2500/7$

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for $x$ and $y$ under the constraints given by the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $2500/7$ or approximately 357.14.

The solution provided is correct. The steps taken to isolate and simplify the systems of equations derived from the absolute value condition are well applied and accurately calculated. The use of the formula for the minimum of a quadratic function is correct and well explained, leading to an accurate final result of $2500/7$ or approximately 357.14. There were no errors in this solution. 

Therefore, we can TERMINATE this check since the solution has been correctly solved using the right steps.

This is the incorrect answer. On the first try, the checker suggested changes and nothing happened. This time I allowed the checker to communicate with the calculator, which provided a response, but not the right one.
