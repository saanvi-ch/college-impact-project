    "Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?\n",

    "A well-known mathematician suggests finding the vertex of the parabola to find points $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the advice to find the vertex of the parabola is suitable for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of the parabola is given by $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ which is a type of standard form for a parabola: $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The vertex $(h, k)$ of any parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $h = -b/2a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this parabola, $h = 1$ because $a = k$ and $b = -2k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $h = 1$ into the equation of the parabola, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex: $k = k*1^2 - 2k*1 + l = k - 2k + l = l - k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the vertex of the parabola is $(1, l-k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at points $A$ and $B$. The y-coordinate of these intersection points is $4$. Because the parabola is symmetric with respect to the line $x = 1$, it follows that points $A$ and $B$ equidistant from the line $x = 1$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $6$, each of $A$ and $B$ is $3$ units away from the line $x = 1$. So, we have $A = (-2, 4)$ and $B = (4, 4)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance of a point $(x, y)$ from the origin is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{20}$ and\n",
    "$\\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{32}$, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
