The five numbers in the geometric sequence are 2-digit integers, implying that the first term should be a relatively small number, otherwise the fifth term could easily exceed 99, violating the 2-digit only constraint.

Starting with an initial guess of 1, we can incrementally increase it until a geometric sequence is found that satisfies the conditions.

By the property of geometric sequences, each term is the preceding term multiplied by the common ratio. 

For example, where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio, the sequence a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4 should be composed of all integers, where the terms ar^3 and ar^4 should still be 2-digit numbers. 

So we look for the smallest 'r' with 'a' starting from small numbers (say 5, 'r' starting from 2). Quickly, you will find that when a = 12 and r = 2, you get a sequence (12, 24, 48, 96) which are all 2-digit numbers and integers. But the 5th term would be 192 which is a three digit number. This implies that you have to look for 'r' which is less than 2. 

Searching again from 'r' = 1.5, you will find that 'a' = 16 and 'r' = 1.5 yields a sequence (16, 24, 36, 54, 81) which comprises five 2-digit integers.

So the sum of the sequence 16, 24, 36, 54, 81 is 16+24+36+54+81 = 211.

(1, 1.5, 2.25, 3.375, 5.0625)

(2, 3, 4.5, 6.75, 10.125)
...
(12, 24, 48, 96, 192)
...
(16, 24, 36, 54, 81)

16+24+36+54+81 = 211

So, the unique sum of the five 2-digit positive integers that form an increasing geometric sequence is 211.
