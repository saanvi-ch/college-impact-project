problem:

    There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?

plan:

    1. Step 1: Understand that an increasing geometric sequence of any number of terms will have its first and last terms as the smallest and the largest respectively.

    2. Step 2: Recognize the constraints of the problem. Here, the terms are 2-digit positive integers, which range from 10 to 99. 

    3. Step 3: Take into consideration that the first term should be as small as possible and the last term as large as possible to maximize the middle terms, it might be necessary to adjust this assumption based on the problem's constraints.

    4. Step 4: Based on the understanding of the properties of a geometric sequence, set up an equation with the first term (initially assumed as 10) multiplied by the common ratio to the power of (n-1), where n is the number of terms (in this case, 5), equals to the last term (initially assumed as 99).

    5. Step 5: Resolve the resulting equation to find the common ratio.

    6. Step 6: Use the common ratio to produce the remaining terms of the sequence.

    7. Step 7: Calculate the sum of all the terms once they are generated. This sum will be the solution to the problem.

    8. Step 8: Validate this solution with the problem statement to ensure that it satisfies all the conditions given - in this case, that all the terms are 2-digit positive integers. If it doesn't, adjust the first or last term accordingly and repeat the process from Step 4. 

    The addition of Step 8 ensures that the solution generated is indeed suitable to the problem statement and isn't just based on assumptions.

final solution:

    The sequence is 12, 15, 18, 22, and 27 with a sum of 94.

    Explanation:
    Using the first and last two-digit numbers (10 and 99) as the smallest and largest terms in an increasing geometric sequence might not provide the correct sequence fitting the conditions. So, we have to adjust our assumptions.
    Upon adjusting the first term to 12 and keeping the last term as 27 (both being two-digit positive integers), using the formula a*r^(n-1) = last term and the fourth root of the ratio of the last term to the first term, we find that the common ratio (r) should be approximately 1.2. Applying this common ratio to generate the other terms in the sequence, we get the unique sequence that fulfills the conditions. Finally, we add up all the terms in the sequence (12, 15, 18, 22, and 27) to find the sum, which is 94.

comments:

    This is the incorrect answer. Despite checking the solution (both by the checker for each step and as step 8 in the planning process), ChatGPT didn't recognize that the terms of the sequence must be integers WITHOUT ROUNDING. This seems to be a recurring issue, so I wonder if it's just the unclear phrasing of the question.
