problem: Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.


solution:

Problem Constraints:
1) We are rolling four 6-sided fair dice, so all four rolls have equal probability.
2) We are asked to find the probability that the highest roll is a 5 (not a 6).
3) We need the answer as a relatively prime fraction in the form $a/b$ and the sum of $a$ and $b$.
4) The dice rolls are discrete and independent events. 

<scratch>
To calculate this probability, we need to find two things: 
1) The total number of possible outcomes.
2) The number of outcomes where the highest number rolled is a 5.

1) Since we are rolling four dice, each of which has 6 different outcomes, the total number of possible outcomes stands at
$6^4 = 1296$.

2) For the outcomes where the highest number is 5, we consider that each of the four dice can roll a number from 1 to 5. Thus, the total number of these outcomes is:
$5^4 = 625$.

Therefore, the probability that the highest number rolled is a 5 is 
$p= \frac{625}{1296}$.

However, this is not in lowest terms. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 625 and 1296 to simplify it.

The GCD of 625 and 1296 is 1 (they are relatively prime), so our fraction is already in simplest form.

So, a = 625 and b = 1296.

Final Response: $a + b = 625 + 1296 = 1921$


comments:

This is incorrect because it takes into account the probability that all the numbers are less than six but not the probability that all the numbers are less than 5 (which should be subtracted from the previous probability). When I ran this again, it got closer once (with the right method but the rounding was wrong), but it never got the right answer.
