problem: For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $||x-1|-2| = m/100$ have $4$ integer solutions?


solution:

Problem Constraints:
1) The equation to solve is $||x-1|-2| = m/100$, and we are trying to find how many positive integer values of $m$ will make this equation be true for 4 integer values of $x$.
2) We must count only integer solutions for $x$.
3) The output $m$ must be an integer and is also divided by 100 in the equation.

Let's start by breaking down the absolute value equation:
$||x-1|-2|$

When $x \leq 1$, we see that $|x-1|$ is equivalent to $1-x$, so our equation becomes $|1-x-2| = |3-x|.$

When $1 < x \leq 3$, we have $|x-1| = x-1$, so our equation becomes $|x-1-2| = |x-3|.$

When $x > 3$, we have $|x-1| = x-1$, so our equation becomes again $|x-1-2| = |x-3|$.

Therefore, we can see that we have three ranges of x which we will be considering: $(-\infty, 1]$, $(1,3]$, and $(3,\infty)$. In each of these ranges, the absolute values become $3-x$,$x-3$ and $x-3$, respectively.

However, the left-hand side of the equation is another absolute value, so let's start with the range $(-\infty, 1]$. In this case, there's one situation which we will consider.
1) For $(3-x)$, when $x \leq 3$ , we get $3-x$ , and when $x > 3$ , we have to change the sign of $3-x$ , so it becomes $x-3$.

For the range $(1,3]$, we only need to consider where $x-3$ is positive, which is when $x>3$.

However, for the range $(3,\infty)$, we also have two situations to consider.
1) For $(x-3)$, when $3 \leq x$ , we get $x-3$ , and when $x < 3$ , we have to change the sign of $x-3$ , so it becomes $3-x$.

Therefore, we find that the equation $||x-1|-2| = m/100$ breaks down into two possible equations for each of the three $x$ ranges and these equations yield integer solutions for $x$ as follows:
1) When $x \leq 3$, equation is $3 - x = m/100$. This equation has integer solutions for $x$ when $3 \leq m \leq 300$.
2) When $x > 3$, equation is $x - 3 = m/100$. This equation has integer solutions for $x$ when $m$ is any multiple of 100 greater than 300.

Now, we are only interested in the positive integer values of $m$ for which there are *four* integer solutions for $x$. To satisfy this condition, we need to find the overlap between the two cases above. The equation $||x-1|-2| = m/100$ must be true for at least four integer values of $x$. 

Combining the two cases, it is found when $3 \leq m \leq 300$.  However, since each of these produces just one solution, and we need it to be true for four integer values of $x$, the values of $m$ that work are the multiples of $100$ in between $300$ and $3$ inclusive.

Those would be $100$, $200$, $300$.

Final Response: So there are 3 positive integer values of $m$ that allow the equation $||x-1|-2| = m/100$ to have exactly four integer solutions for x.

This is the incorrect answer. I ran it five times to check if it improves its response, but it didn't.
